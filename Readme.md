# Co-authorship Recommender System via GRaph Embeddings

## Quantatitive comparison
Two *.xlsx tables represent results of comparison several models of feature engineering, machine learning predictive models and link embedding.
We do not include them in appendix due to volume constrains for the paper.

We were the first to present new link embedding based on local proximity in embedding space outperforming existing solutions.

## Code
There are several *.ipynb code implementations. While we are still in the process of organizing code for Ocean code repository, we present the preliminary results for loading dataset and evaluating our model based on uploaded data for HSE and HSE_Scopus publications.
