This article considers the role of metaphorical using of these categories in such Arendt's texts as ""Vita activa, or about the activities of life"", ""Life of the Mind"", ""Thinking and moral considerations"". How does the socratic daimon (daimonion) become a metaphor in Arendt's philosophy? What functions does his image play in Arendt's concepts of action and thinking? What things do separate and unite the context of the metaphorical application of these terms in her different texts?

The drive gives rise to a convective (but not absolute) instability in the system. The resulting NLSE includes a pseudo-stimulated-Raman-scattering (pseudo-SRS) term, which is a spatial-domain counterpart of the SRS term, a well-known ingredient of the temporal-domain NLSE in optics. Analysis of the field-momentum balance and direct simulations demonstrates that wave-number downshift by the pseudo-SRS may be compensated by the upshift induced by the wind traction, thus maintaining robust bright solitons in both stationary and oscillatory forms; in particular, they are not destroyed by the underlying convective instability. Analytical soliton solutions are found in an approximate form and are verified by numerical simulations. Solutions for soliton pairs are obtained in the numerical form. © 2015 American Physical Society.",,"Nonlinear equations; Solitons; Surface waves; Analytical solitons; Bright solitons; Convective instabilities; Dinger equation; Direct simulation; Dynamics of solitons; High-frequency surfaces; Spatial domains; Stimulated Raman scattering",,"American Physical Society",,,,,15393755,,PLEEE,"English","Phys.

Unfortunately, for the case of binary codes the IPP property does not hold even in the case of only two traitors. A recent work has considered a natural generalization of IPP-codes for the binary case, where the identifiable parent property should hold with probability almost 1. It has been shown that almost t-IPP codes of nonvanishing rate exist for the case t = 2. Surprisingly enough, collusion secure digital fingerprinting codes do not automatically possess this almost IPP property. In practice, this means that for a given forged fingerprint, say z, a user identified as guilty by the tracing algorithm can deny this claim since he will be able to present a coalition of users that can create the same z, but he does not belong to that coalition.

These communities as case of informal economy initially do not have formal attributed rules. It is essential to find out (1) which rules and mechanisms exist in this type of economy; (2) what motivates people who are not acquainted with another to exchange gifts; and (3) understand the way this community exists. The conclusion is drawn that social capital is the basic engine of investigated communities. The social capital accumulated by users increases the community commitment and cohesion by interpreting gifts as a set of resources to distribute fairly. The giving, the receiving and the exchanging are forms of communication that cause further communication and interworking outside of giftgiving situations. These gift-exchange communities are mainly based on the communication and consumption solidarity among individuals. © Elizaveta Polukhina, Anna Strelnikova, and Nova Southeastern University.","Commodity; Consumption; Cultural studies; Gift-exchange; Mixed of online and offline methods; Mobility of domestic items; Nethnography; Online communities; Social solidarity",,,"Nova Southeastern University",,,,,10520147,,,"English","Qual.

Here, we studied these adjustments by analyzing post-error modulations of alpha and theta band activity in the auditory version of the two-choice condensation task, which is highly demanding for sustained attention while involves no inhibition of prepotent responses. Errors were followed by increased frontal midline theta (FMT) activity, as well as by enhanced alpha band suppression in the parietal and the left central regions; parietal alpha suppression correlated with the task performance, left central alpha suppression correlated with the post-error slowing, and FMT increase correlated with both behavioral measures. On post-error correct trials, left-central alpha band suppression started earlier before the response, and the response was followed by weaker FMT activity, as well as by enhanced alpha band suppression distributed over the entire scalp. These findings indicate that several separate neuronal networks are involved in post-error adjustments, including the midfrontal performance monitoring network, the parietal attentional network, and the sensorimotor network. Supposedly, activity within these networks is rapidly modulated after errors, resulting in optimization of their functional state on the subsequent trials, with corresponding changes in behavioral measures. © 2015 Novikov, Bryzgalov and Chernyshev.","Alpha oscillations; Cognitive control; Errors; Post-error trials; Posterror adaptations; Theta oscillations; Time-frequency decomposition","attention; error; modulation; monitoring; nerve cell network; scalp; task performance; theta rhythm",,"Frontiers Media S.

In contrast to the competitors such as superconductor-insulator-superconductor tunnel junctions and Schottky diodes, the hot electron bolometer (HEB) did not demonstrate any frequency limitation of the detection mechanism. The latter, in conjunction with a decent performance, rapidly made the HEB mixer the most attractive candidate for heterodyne observations at frequencies above 1 THz. The successful operation of practical instruments (the Heinrich Hertz Telescope, the Receiver Lab Telescope, APEX, SOFIA, Hershel) ensures the importance of the HEB technology despite the lack of rigorous theoretical routine for predicting the performance.

For this purpose, the Smoluchowski-Debye equation for a pure Coulomb potential with a reflecting boundary condition on the recombination sphere has been solved numerically and analytically (in the last case, only approximately). It has been shown that the probability of the pair non-dissociation decreases in time roughly as a power law. We also discussed the applicability of the conductivity method for studying the non-Langevin recombination in low mobility solids. An example of such an analysis is given for one technical polymer.

Recent progress in next-generation sequencing technologies has provided an opportunity for the deep T cell receptor repertoire profiling. However, a specialised software is required for the rational analysis of massive data generated by next-generation sequencing. Results: Here we introduce tcR, a new R package, representing a platform for the advanced analysis of T cell receptor repertoires, which includes diversity measures, shared T cell receptor sequences identification, gene usage statistics computation and other widely used methods. The tool has proven its utility in recent research studies. Conclusions: tcR is an R package for the advanced analysis of T cell receptor repertoires after primary TR sequences extraction from raw sequencing reads. The stable version can be directly installed from The Comprehensive R Archive Network (http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). The source code and development version are available at tcR GitHub (http://imminfo.github.io/tcr/) along with the full documentation and typical usage examples. © 2015 Nazarov et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Adaptive immunity; T cell receptor; TR diversity; TR repertoire analysis","Antigen-antibody reactions; Cell membranes; Cells; Cytology; Adaptive immune response; Adaptive immunity; Advanced analysis; Antigen recognition; Next-generation sequencing; T cell receptor; TR diversity; TR repertoire analysis; T-cells; immunoglobulin; lymphocyte antigen receptor; computer language; DNA sequence; genetics; high throughput sequencing; human; immunology; procedures; software; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Immunoglobulins; Programming Languages; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",,,,,14712105,,BBMIC,"English","BMC Bioinform.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939258340

The problem of job flow distribution is solved in terms of jobs and computing resource domains compatibility. A coefficient estimating such compatibility is introduced and studied experimentally. Two distribution strategies are suggested. Job framework forming is justified with such quality of service indicators as an average job execution time, a number of required scheduling cycles, and a number of job execution declines. Two methods for job selection and scheduling are proposed and compared: the first one is based on the knapsack problem solution, while the second one utilizes the mentioned compatibility coefficient. Along with these methods we present experimental results demonstrating the efficiency of proposed approaches and compare them with random job selection. © 2015 IEEE.","Batch; Flow; Grid; Job; Knapsack problem; Resource management; Scheduling; Virtual organization","Combinatorial optimization; Quality of service; Batch; Flow; Grid; Job; Knapsack problems; Resource management; Virtual organization; Scheduling","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","44th Annual Conference of the International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops, ICPPW 2015","1 September 2015 through 4 September 2015",,117723,15302016,9781467375894,,"English","Proc.

Our approach is based on ranking all the combinations of strategy design (5184 strategies) and the disclosure of the momentum effect with two criteria (mean return and risk) controlling for momentum return probability distribution.It is new perspective on the momentum effect permitting its analysis from a comprehensive view taking into account the strategy's different design elements and observing how the disposition of investor preferences has changed depending on the criterion. We distinguish two criteria: (1) maximizing the mean return of the investment with control t-statistics and the author's innovation with the Bootstrap p-value, (2) minimizing the risk approximated by the number of drawdowns.

2013 (GBD 2013) is the first of a series of annual updates of the GBD. Risk factor quantification, particularly of modifiable risk factors, can help to identify emerging threats to population health and opportunities for prevention. The GBD 2013 provides a timely opportunity to update the comparative risk assessment with new data for exposure, relative risks, and evidence on the appropriate counterfactual risk distribution. Methods: Attributable deaths, years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) have been estimated for 79 risks or clusters of risks using the GBD 2010 methods. Risk-outcome pairs meeting explicit evidence criteria were assessed for 188 countries for the period 1990-2013 by age and sex using three inputs: risk exposure, relative risks, and the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL). Risks are organised into a hierarchy with blocks of behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks at the first level of the hierarchy. The next level in the hierarchy includes nine clusters of related risks and two individual risks, with more detail provided at levels 3 and 4 of the hierarchy. Compared with GBD 2010, six new risk factors have been added: handwashing practices, occupational exposure to trichloroethylene, childhood wasting, childhood stunting, unsafe sex, and low glomerular filtration rate. For most risks, data for exposure were synthesised with a Bayesian metaregression method, DisMod-MR 2.0, or spatial-temporal Gaussian process regression. Relative risks were based on meta-regressions of published cohort and intervention studies. Attributable burden for clusters of risks and all risks combined took into account evidence on the mediation of some risks such as high body-mass index (BMI) through other risks such as high systolic blood pressure and high cholesterol. Findings: All risks combined account for 57·2% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 55·8-58·5) of deaths and 41·6% (40·1-43·0) of DALYs. Risks quantified account for 87·9% (86·5-89·3) of cardiovascular disease DALYs, ranging to a low of 0% for neonatal disorders and neglected tropical diseases and malaria. In terms of global DALYs in 2013, six risks or clusters of risks each caused more than 5% of DALYs: dietary risks accounting for 11·3 million deaths and 241·4 million DALYs, high systolic blood pressure for 10·4 million deaths and 208·1 million DALYs, child and maternal malnutrition for 1·7 million deaths and 176·9 million DALYs, tobacco smoke for 6·1 million deaths and 143·5 million DALYs, air pollution for 5·5 million deaths and 141·5 million DALYs, and high BMI for 4·4 million deaths and 134·0 million DALYs. Risk factor patterns vary across regions and countries and with time. In sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risk factors are child and maternal malnutrition, unsafe sex, and unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing. In women, in nearly all countries in the Americas, north Africa, and the Middle East, and in many other high-income countries, high BMI is the leading risk factor, with high systolic blood pressure as the leading risk in most of Central and Eastern Europe and south and east Asia. For men, high systolic blood pressure or tobacco use are the leading risks in nearly all high-income countries, in north Africa and the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. For men and women, unsafe sex is the leading risk in a corridor from Kenya to South Africa. Interpretation: Behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks can explain half of global mortality and more than one-third of global DALYs providing many opportunities for prevention. Of the larger risks, the attributable burden of high BMI has increased in the past 23 years.

In practice original high-dimensional data are transformed into lower-dimensional representations (features) preserving certain subject-driven data properties such as distances or geodesic distances, angles, etc. Preserving as much as possible available information contained in the original high-dimensional data is also an important and desirable property of the representation. The real-world high-dimensional data typically lie on or near a certain unknown low-dimensional manifold (Data manifold) embedded in an ambient high-dimensional 'observation' space, so in this article we assume this Manifold assumption to be fulfilled. An exact isometric manifold embedding in a low-dimensional space is possible in certain special cases only, so we consider the problem of constructing a 'locally isometric and conformal' embedding, which preserves distances and angles between close points. We propose a new geometrically motivated locally isometric and conformal representation method, which employs Tangent Manifold Learning technique consisting in sample-based estimation of tangent spaces to the unknown Data manifold. In numerical experiments, the proposed method compares favourably with popular Manifold Learning methods in terms of isometric and conformal embedding properties as well as of accuracy of Data manifold reconstruction from the sample. © 2015 IEEE.","Conformal embedding; Dimensionality Reduction; High Dimensional Data; Isometric embedding; Low Dimensional Features; Manifold Learning; Tangent Manifold Learning","Clustering algorithms; Learning systems; Numerical methods; Conformal embedding; Dimensionality reduction; High dimensional data; Isometric embeddings; Low dimensional; Manifold learning; Data mining","Booz Allen Hamilton;et al.;IEEE Big Data Initiative;IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS);InfoSys;Tata Consultancy Services","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics, DSAA 2015","19 October 2015 through 21 October 2015",,118725,,9781467382731,,"English","Proc.

The KLEMS (capital, labor, energy, materials and services) production factors and multifactor productivity embedded in the model play the role of parameters measuring interactions between market outputs and technology innovation according to market-pull and technology-push effects. The qualitative methods include: STEEPV trend identification, 2. ×. 2 scenario analysis, and expert procedures. This allows for decreasing the number of parameters, inputs and calculations in the economic model. At the same time, balance between qualitative and quantitative techniques provide more realistic estimates for technological and market parameters.

Monetary policy turned toward a relaxation with a sequential cause of interest rates and reserve ratios going down. But the possibilities of a further monetary softening are limited because of a high leverage both at the corporate and parastatal sectors, and of a huge overcapacity at the various branches of manufacturing. Nevertheless, hard landing is unlikely to happen in the nearest future. Growth may sustain due not only to the monetary stimuli, but also to new institutional reforms. China's economy is really rebalancing in favor of services, and that process leads to a fast creation of jobs, which, in its turn, assists a consumer demand's expansion. Such a shift is promoted with the newly carried out tax reforms carried out newly at the service sector. The investment demand has been weakening, not least because of the government's efforts to curb the shadow banking activities and to deleverage at the regional and municipal levels. But, at the same time, a huge amount of new businesses has been established as a result of the minimum capital requirements liberalization. The concept of a ""mixed ownership"" pioneered by the top State leaders actually implies a new phase of privatization. Public-private partnership is being installed at the number of infrastructural industries. A wave of new reforms is also prevailing at the banking and equity markets. The government assists the Chinese companies' entry into foreign markets with additional export promotion policies and the ""Go Out"" investment drive.","""New normality""; China; Economic growth; Financial markets; Inflation; Investment platforms; Real estate; Shadow banking",,,"Primakov National Research Institute",,,,,01312227,,,"Russian","World Economy Int.

On the one hand, officials of many countries have announced intentions to participate in its development. On the other hand, numerous studies aimed at measuring the economic viability of the NSR navigation indicate that the route has limited potential and is suitable only for a relatively small segment of shipping. This study is dedicated to solve this contradiction focusing on two different rationales of the NSR use: 1) current economic feasibility which is defined by the level of transportation costs in comparison to alternative transport routes; 2) long-term prospects of the NSR development determined by long-term trends and strategic interests of various countries. It is revealed that the NSR is commercially viable only for bulk cargo transportation in warmer months from and to ports located not far from the NSR. In the long term the effectiveness of the NSR can increase under conditions of further ice melting, development of Russian Arctic zone, in particular, the infrastructure along the NSR, and increasing political and other risks along the traditional trade routes between Europe and Asia. On the contrary, the slowdown in Asia-European trade and the suspension of some oil Sc gas projects in Russian Arctic worsen to some extent the NSR prospects.","Arctic; International shipping; International trade routes; Northern Sea Route; Russia's arctic zone","cargo handling; cost; international trade; port operation; port trade; shipping; transportation economics; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea; Russian Federation",,"Gruppo Editoriale Internazionale Srl.",,,,,03035247,,,"English","Int.

The author also tests whether the effects of the Protestant work ethic extend beyond the religious population of Protestant countries. The multilevel models built on 25,437 respondents in 55 countries show no significant difference in work ethic between Muslims and Protestants. Living in a historically Protestant society does not increase work ethic, but being religious in a Protestant society does. As countries develop, work ethic is likely to decrease.

Korea’s rapid development over the past half-century has led to the diversification of groups from whom the government must seek legitimacy, and it is argued that the committee-based system continues to be adopted due to its ability to incorporate these diverse voices into the policy making process, while at the same time allowing the government to further its developmental agenda.

As known, solvability of a system depends entirely on properties of its differential Galois group. However, detecting solvability or non-solvability of a given system is a difficult problem, because the dependence of its differential Galois group on the coefficients of the system remains unknown. We consider systems with regular singular points as well as those with non-resonant irregular ones, whose exponents (respectively, so-called formal exponents in the irregular case) are sufficiently small. It turns out that for systems satisfying such restrictions criteria of solvability can be given in terms of the coefficient matrix. © 2015, Institute for Mathematical Sciences (IMS), Stony Brook University, NY.","Differential Galois group; Liouvillian solution; Picard–Vessiot extension; Stokes matrices",,,"Springer International Publishing",,,,,21996792,,,"English","Arnold Math.

It uses a structured FTA approach to offer guidance for the design of foresight exercises supporting such priority setting, drawing on the case of S&T cooperation between EU Member States, countries associated to the FP7, and Russia. A framework is proposed for thematic priority setting through the application of Future-oriented Technology Analysis (FTA) and for achieving clear policy impacts by including principles for impact optimisation. A combination of foresight methodologies such as expert workshops, a Delphi survey, roadmapping elements, and prioritisation techniques was applied to select relevant topics for a joint research call. The paper shows how foresight can be embedded in a multilateral S&T programme cooperation using a set of coordination dimensions and design principles. Strategies for achieving policy impact and for communicating foresight results are also outlined. Future research is proposed to further improve guidance to facilitate more global research programme cooperation in the future to jointly address global challenges. © 2015.","Foresight; FTA; Multilateral research cooperation; Priority setting","Innovation; Technological forecasting; Foresight; FTA; Global challenges; Priority setting; Research cooperation; Research programmes; Stakeholder groups; Technology analysis; Air navigation; future prospect; international cooperation; policy analysis; research; stakeholder; Europe; Russian Federation",,"Elsevier Inc.",,,,,00401625,,,"English","Technol.

This result suggests that, in collectivist societies with low levels of generalized trust, the lack of citizens' confidence in the fairness and efficiency of public institutions may compromise social order.

To consider possible risk factors that might influence formation of coronary artery (CA) aneurisms in children with Kawasaki disease (KD). Patients and methods. We retrospectively analyzed data of medical case records of 168 patients aged 1 month 13 days to 13 years 6 months, who visited the University children's clinical hospital of I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University from 2003 to 2014. All patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1 included 24 (14.2%) infants aged not more than 6 months, group 2 - 31 (18.34%) infants aged 6-12 months. Patients aged 12 months to 5 years comprised group 3 - 94 (55.63%); and 19 (11.83%) children older than 5 years - group 4. Results. In no one of patients younger than 6 months fever lasted less than 1 week; the percentage of children, who had fever for 8-14 days was 51.37%. In other groups, this parameter was significantly less. The chance for development of CA aneurisms? increased with each day of persistence of fever for the youngest children by 1.32 times, and for the oldest - by 1.02 times. Patients of group 1 were characterized (differences are reliable; p &lt; 0.05) by the least levels of haemoglobin, significantly more marked thrombocytosis and maximal leukocytosis. Children of group 1 received modern adequate treatment more rarely; after the 10th day of disease diagnosis was most often made in groups 1 and 4, and in the first of them IVIG were more often administered after the 10th day. Among other factors essential for development of coronary artery aneurisms was the influence of a patient's age and the time of the beginning of immunoglobulin therapy. In fact, the frequency of development of CA aneurisms corresponded to the expected one- in the group of children younger than 6 months, coronary artery aneurisms developed in 62.5% of cases. The older a child, the less the chance for development of CA aneurism, provided that treatment was early and adequate. If immunoglobulin was introduced after the 10th day of disease, the age had practically no influence on the chance for development of aneurism. Conclusion. The age of children with KD does not only influence the development of CA aneurisms but also modifies the effect of other risk factors. We noted their greatest number and the highest frequency of development of CA aneurisms in the group of patients younger than 6 months, which might reflect the specificities of the course of KD in the youngest patients, and necessitates intensive initial therapy of disease.","Age; Children; Coronary artery aneurisms; Kawasaki disease; Regression analysis; Risk factors",,,"Dynasty Publishing House",,,,,18177646,,,"Russian","Vopr.

In our theoretical framework, the act of proposing or demanding a bribe violates a commonly held social norm, thus producing a psychological cost. By lowering this psychological cost, particularism increases the probability of offering or asking for a bribe. We test the predictions of the model by using individual-level data for 25 countries from the European Social Survey. Consistent with the theory, particularism is found to have a positive causal effect on the probability of offering a bribe.

Students who apply for a programme with the same score are tied. Ties are broken by lottery in Ireland, by objective factors in Turkey (such as date of birth) and by other precisely defined rules in Spain. In Hungary, however, an equal treatment policy is used, students applying for a programme with the same score are all accepted or rejected together. In such a situation there is only one decision to make, whether or not to admit the last group of applicants with the same score who are at the boundary of the quota. Both concepts can be described in terms of stable score-limits. The strict rejection of the last group with whom a quota would be violated corresponds to the concept of H-stable (i.e. higher-stable) score-limits that is currently used in Hungary. We call the other solutions based on the less strict admission policy as L-stable (i.e. lower-stable) score-limits. We show that the natural extensions of the Gale–Shapley algorithms produce stable score-limits, moreover, the applicant-oriented versions result in the lowest score-limits (thus optimal for students) and the college-oriented versions result in the highest score-limits with regard to each concept. When comparing the applicant-optimal H-stable and L-stable score-limits we prove that the former limits are always higher for every college. Furthermore, these two solutions provide upper and lower boundaries for any solution arising from a tie-breaking strategy. Finally we show that both the H-stable and the L-stable applicant-proposing score-limit algorithms are manipulable. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","College admissions; Mechanism design; Stable matching",,,"Springer Verlag",,,,,1435246X,,,"English","Cent.

We derive the effective Hamiltonian with low-energy cutoff in two transverse phonon polarizations (phononic band gaps) by breaking the symmetry in phonon interactions. Further, we construct the statistical mechanics of states of aggregation employing the Debye approximation. The introduced formalism covers the Debye theory of solids, the phonon theory of liquids, and thermodynamic limits such as the Dulong–Petit thermodynamic limit (cV=3kB), the ideal gas limit [Formula presented]) and the new thermodynamic limit (cV=2kB), dubbed here the Frenkel line thermodynamic limit. We discuss the phonon propagation and localization effects in liquids above and below the Frenkel line, and explain the “fast sound” phenomenon. As a test for our theory we calculate velocity–velocity autocorrelation and pair distribution functions within the Green–Kubo formalism. We show the consistency between dynamics of phonons and pair correlations in the framework of the unified approach. New directions towards advancements in phononic band gaps engineering, hypersound manipulation technologies and exploration of exotic behaviour of fluids relevant to geo- and planetary sciences are discussed.

It involves a boundary-oriented pixel labeling so that the cluster growing is performed by expanding its boundary iteratively. The starting point is a cluster consisting of just one seed, the pixel with the coldest temperature. The baseline version of the SEC algorithm uses Otsu's thresholding method to fine-tune the homogeneity threshold. Unfortunately, this method does not always lead to a satisfactory solution. Therefore, we introduce a self-tuning version of the algorithm in which the homogeneity threshold is locally derived from the approximation criterion over a window around the pixel under consideration. The window serves as a boundary regularizer.These two unsupervised versions of the algorithm have been applied to a set of 28 SST images of the western coast of mainland Portugal, and compared against a supervised version fine-tuned by maximizing the F-measure with respect to manually labeled ground-truth maps. The areas built by the unsupervised versions of the SEC algorithm are significantly coincident over the ground-truth regions in the cases at which the upwelling areas consist of a single continuous fragment of the SST map. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Approximate clustering; Homogeneity criterion; Seeded region growing; SST images; Upwelling","Algorithms; Approximation algorithms; Atmospheric temperature; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Oceanography; Pixels; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Approximate clustering; Homogeneity criterion; Seeded region growing; SST images; Upwelling; Clustering algorithms; algorithm; homogeneity; nearshore dynamics; pixel; sea surface temperature; upwelling; Portugal",,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,00983004,,CGEOD,"English","Comput.

As such, policymakers have constructed a number of different credentials to identify high quality teachers. Unfortunately, few of the credentials used in developing countries have been validated (in terms of whether teachers holding such credentials actually improve student achievement). In this study, we employ a student-fixed effects model to estimate the impact of teacher credentials on student achievement in the context of the biggest education system in the world: China. We find that having a teacher with the highest rank (a credential based on annual assessments by local administrators) has positive impacts on student achievement relative to having a teacher who has not achieved the highest rank. We further find that teacher rank has heterogeneous impacts, benefiting economically poor students more than non-poor students. However, whether a teacher attends college or holds teaching awards does not appear to provide additional information on teacher quality (in terms of improving student achievement). © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","China; Student achievement; Teacher credentials; Teacher quality",,,"Elsevier",,,,,1043951X,,,"English","China Econ.

However, apart from clinical descriptions, to date the pathophysiology of SPD is not fully understood due to the rareness of the syndrome and a lack of experimental studies. In a case study of one patient with schizotypal disorder, we applied a multimodal approach to understanding the SPD phenomena. The patient's clinical profile was identified as disruption of implicit bodily function, accompanied by depressive symptoms. On a neuropsychological level, the patient exhibited impairment in executive functioning, intact tactile perception and kinesthetic praxis. Behavioral tests revealed an altered sense of time but unimpaired self-agency. Furthermore, the patient exhibited a lack of empathy and he had autistic traits, although with a sufficient ability to verbalize his feelings. On the neurobiological level using an active and passive touch paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found a hyperconnectivity of the default-mode network and salience network and a hypoconnectivity of the central executive brain networks in the performance of the touch task as well as intact perceptual touch processing emerging from the direct comparisons of the touch conditions. Our data provide evidence for the important role of altered large-brain network functioning in SPD that corresponds to the specific behavioral and neurocognitive phenomena.

The GBD can be used to generate summary measures such as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE) that make possible comparative assessments of broad epidemiological patterns across countries and time. These summary measures can also be used to quantify the component of variation in epidemiology that is related to sociodemographic development. Methods We used the published GBD 2013 data for age-specific mortality, years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) to calculate DALYs and HALE for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2013 for 188 countries. We calculated HALE using the Sullivan method; 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) represent uncertainty in age-specific death rates and YLDs per person for each country, age, sex, and year. We estimated DALYs for 306 causes for each country as the sum of YLLs and YLDs; 95% UIs represent uncertainty in YLL and YLD rates. We quantified patterns of the epidemiological transition with a composite indicator of sociodemographic status, which we constructed from income per person, average years of schooling after age 15 years, and the total fertility rate and mean age of the population. We applied hierarchical regression to DALY rates by cause across countries to decompose variance related to the sociodemographic status variable, country, and time. Findings Worldwide, from 1990 to 2013, life expectancy at birth rose by 6·2 years (95% UI 5·6-6·6), from 65·3 years (65·0-65·6) in 1990 to 71·5 years (71·0-71·9) in 2013, HALE at birth rose by 5·4 years (4·9-5·8), from 56·9 years (54·5-59·1) to 62·3 years (59·7-64·8), total DALYs fell by 3·6% (0·3-7·4), and age-standardised DALY rates per 100 000 people fell by 26·7% (24·6-29·1). For communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, global DALY numbers, crude rates, and age-standardised rates have all declined between 1990 and 2013, whereas for non-communicable diseases, global DALYs have been increasing, DALY rates have remained nearly constant, and age-standardised DALY rates declined during the same period. From 2005 to 2013, the number of DALYs increased for most specific non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, in addition to dengue, food-borne trematodes, and leishmaniasis; DALYs decreased for nearly all other causes. By 2013, the five leading causes of DALYs were ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, cerebrovascular disease, low back and neck pain, and road injuries. Sociodemographic status explained more than 50% of the variance between countries and over time for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; maternal disorders; neonatal disorders; nutritional deficiencies; other communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases; musculoskeletal disorders; and other non-communicable diseases. However, sociodemographic status explained less than 10% of the variance in DALY rates for cardiovascular diseases; chronic respiratory diseases; cirrhosis; diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases; unintentional injuries; and self-harm and interpersonal violence. Predictably, increased sociodemographic status was associated with a shift in burden from YLLs to YLDs, driven by declines in YLLs and increases in YLDs from musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, and mental and substance use disorders. In most country-specific estimates, the increase in life expectancy was greater than that in HALE. Leading causes of DALYs are highly variable across countries. Interpretation Global health is improving. Population growth and ageing have driven up numbers of DALYs, but crude rates have remained relatively constant, showing that progress in health does not mean fewer demands on health systems. The notion of an epidemiological transition - in which increasing sociodemographic status brings structured change in disease burden - is useful, but there is tremendous variation in burden of disease that is not associated with sociodemographic status. This further underscores the need for country-specific assessments of DALYs and HALE to appropriately inform health policy decisions and attendant actions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; automutilation; brain disease; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; cerebrovascular disease; chronic kidney disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; chronic respiratory tract disease; congenital malformation; dengue; depression; diabetes mellitus; diarrhea; disability; disability adjusted life year; drowning; educational status; endocrine disease; female; fertility; health status; hematologic disease; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; income; iron deficiency anemia; ischemic heart disease; leishmaniasis; life expectancy; liver cirrhosis; low back pain; major clinical study; malaria; male; malignant neoplastic disease; maternal disease; measles; meningitis; mental disease; mortality; musculoskeletal disease; neck pain; neurologic disease; newborn disease; non communicable disease; nutritional deficiency; nutritional disorder; premature mortality; priority journal; protein calorie malnutrition; respiratory tract infection; substance abuse; tetanus; traffic accident; tuberculosis; urogenital tract disease; violence; chronic disease; Communicable Diseases; health; middle aged; population dynamics; quality adjusted life year; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; Wounds and Injuries; Aged; Chronic Disease; Communicable Diseases; Female; Global Health; Health Transition; Humans; Life Expectancy; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality, Premature; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Socioeconomic Factors; Wounds and Injuries",,"Lancet Publishing Group",,,,,01406736,,LANCA,"English","Lancet",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949086655

We prove that the proposed expression satisfies Painlevé VI τ function bilinear equations (and therefore prove the conjecture). The proof reduces to the proof of bilinear relations on conformal blocks. These relations were studied using the embedding of a direct sum of two Virasoro algebras into a sum of Majorana fermion and Super Virasoro algebra.

It was maintained that photothermoelectric effect under certain conditions results in strong response of such devices to terahertz radiation even at room temperature. In this work, we investigate different mechanisms underlying the response of asymmetric carbon nanotube (CNT) based devices to sub-terahertz and terahertz radiation. Our structures are formed with CNT networks instead of individual CNTs so that effects probed are more generic and not caused by peculiarities of an individual nanoscale object. We conclude that the DC voltage response observed in our structures is not only thermal in origin. So called diode-type response caused by asymmetry of the device IV characteristic turns out to be dominant at room temperature. Quantitative analysis provides further routes for the optimization of the device configuration, which may result in appearance of novel terahertz radiation detectors. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Carbon nanotubes; Electromagnetic wave emission; Nanotubes; Radiation detectors; Yarn; Asymmetric carbons; Device configurations; Different mechanisms; IV characteristics; Nano-scale objects; Photo-thermoelectric; Sub-terahertz; Terahertz radiation; Terahertz waves",,"American Institute of Physics Inc.",,,,,00218979,,JAPIA,"English","J Appl Phys",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947969162

Based on this classification we formulate an asymptotic logarithmic version of Calabi's conjecture for del Pezzo surfaces for the existence of Kähler-Einstein edge metrics in this regime. We make some initial progress towards its proof by demonstrating some existence and non-existence results, among them a generalization of Matsushima's result on the reductivity of the automorphism group of the pair, and results on log canonical thresholds of pairs. One by-product of this study is a new conjectural picture for the small angle regime and limit which reveals a rich structure in the asymptotic regime, of which a folklore conjecture concerning the case of a Fano manifold with an anticanonical divisor is a special case. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Conical singularities; Fano varieties; Kahler edge metrics; Kahler-Einstein metric; Log Fano varieties",,,"Academic Press Inc.",,,,,00018708,,,"English","Adv.

Rowe. The study aimed to assess the reformist potential of Russian school principals. We believe that this potential is determined in the present context by a leadership style that involves teachers in decision-making processes and the delegation of responsibilities to them in uncertain situations that require them to solve extremely complex tasks. Using the two-factor leadership model proposed by B. Bass, we suggest that either the transformational or transactional leadership style may prove to be effective depending on a given school's individual circumstances. Consequently, two types of leaders may be the most effective in terms of their ability to enact reforms: (1) principals who mainly exhibit a conceptual decision-making style and secondarily make recourse to an analytical style; (2) principals who mainly exhibit an analytical decision-making style and secondarily make resource to a conceptual style. The article establishes that only 12% of school principals apply the conceptual decision-making style while relying on an analytical style to a secondary degree. These are the principals who we classify as transformational leaders. Only 11% are effectively prepared to implement changes given a specific environment. These are the transactional leaders who are likely to change their leadership style for a transformational one. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,"Routledge",,,,,10609393,,,"English","Russ.

Integration of different types of connectivity data (such as co-expression and genetic interactions) in one network has proven to benefit 'guilt by association' analysis. However predictive values of connectives of different types, that had their specific functional meaning and topological characteristics were not obvious, and have been addressed in this analysis. Methods: eQTL data for 3 experimental C.elegans age groups were retrieved from WormQTL. WormNet has been used to obtain pair-wise gene interactions. The Shortest Path Function (SPF) has been adopted for statistical validation of the co-expressed gene clusters and for computational prediction of their potential gene expression regulators from a network context. A new SPF-based algorithm has been applied to genetic interactions sub-networks adjacent to the clusters of co-expressed genes for ranking the most likely gene expression regulators causal to eQTLs. Results: We have demonstrated that known co-expression and genetic interactions between C. Elegans genes can be complementary in predicting gene expression regulators. Several algorithms were compared in respect to their predictive potential in different network connectivity contexts. We found that genes associated with eQTLs are highly clustered in a C. Elegans co-expression sub-network, and their adjacent genetic interactions provide the optimal functional connectivity environment for application of the new SPF-based algorithm. It was successfully tested in the reverse-prediction analysis on groups of genes with known regulators and applied to co-expressed genes and experimentally observed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Conclusions: This analysis demonstrates differences in topology and connectivity of co-expression and genetic interactions sub-networks in WormNet. The modularity of less continuous genetic interaction network does not correspond to modularity of the dense network comprised by gene co-expression interactions. However the genetic interaction network can be used much more efficiently with the SPF method in prediction of potential regulators of gene expression. The developed method can be used for validation of functional significance of suggested eQTLs and a discovery of new regulatory modules. © 2015 Valba et al.","eQTL; Longevity; Networks; Regulatory genes; The shortest paths","Article; Caenorhabditis elegans; controlled study; gene cluster; gene expression; gene interaction; gene regulatory network; predictive value; priority journal; quantitative trait locus; regulator gene",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",,,,,17560381,,,"English","BioData Min.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959234689

The hypothesis was that the psychological effectiveness of interactive advertising was higher. To test the hypotheses, an experiment was conducted. The results of the experiment showed that there were no differences in consumer’s trust to non-interactive and interactive advertising; however, it was found that interactive advertising contributes into actualization of a more active life position of the respondents, to the higher level of reflection and personal involvement in the advertising scene.

The initial conditions for solving this problem are derived from the previously discussed problem of the uniform stretching of a tissue fragment (explant) with subsequent fixation of the obtained length. In this study we used the previously developed continuum model that describes the stress–strain state of epithelial tissue taking the parameters that characterize the shape of the cells and their stress state into account, as well as the active stresses they exert when they interact with each other. The experimentally observed continuation of the deformation of a stretched tissue after the external force has ceased to act is described theoretically as a result of active cell reactions to mechanical stress. The duration of explant fixation is shown to have a strong effect on its further elongation and on the pattern of cell activity. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","active media; cell systems; embryonic epithelium",,,"Maik Nauka-Interperiodica Publishing",,,,,00063509,,,"English","Biophysics",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958773526

The planet and its moon (or two asteroids) move about their center of mass in unperturbed elliptic Keplerian orbits. We discuss the possibilities to cause a prescribed motion of the system by changing the tether's length. Periodic solutions of the equation for the tether length control are studied using the method of small parameter. The stability of these solutions is studied numerically. The analysis shows that there exists a control law that implements tether rotations which are uniform with respect to true anomaly; one can indicate conditions when the above rotations are stable in the first approximation. These results can be used for the development of a planet elevator or a system for payload transportation to and from asteroid surface. © 2015 IAA Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Research Findings: Our results show that shareholder coalitions affect payout policy negatively (both for dividends and shares repurchases). We also find that the divergence between the voting rights involved in the coalition and the dominant owner's voting rights is negatively related to dividends. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our findings suggest that shareholder coalitions can serve as an instrument for the dominant shareholders to extract private benefits. Our results also mean that the dominant owner uses the coalition as a mechanism to amplify his or her control over the firm and reduce the cost of expropriation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Regulators should pay attention to the double role of shareholder agreements, as these coalitions could become an entrenchment mechanism for dominant shareholders. Our results highlight the importance of considering shareholder agreements when investors analyze the corporate dividend policy. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Corporate governance; Dividends; Dominant owner; Ownership structure; Shareholder coalitions",,,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",,,,,09648410,,,"English","Corp.

The wonderful fact is that for a given n all zeroes are not chaotically scattered around the moduli space, but lie on smooth curves, with just a few cusps, located at zeroes of discriminant x (Fn). We call this phenomenon the Mandelbrot property. If approached by the cabling method, symmetrically-colored HOMFLY polynomials HnK(A|q) can be considered as linear forms on the n-th “power” of the knot K, and one can wonder if zeroes of resultant q2 (Hn, Hm) can also possess the Mandelbrot property. We present and discuss such resultant-zeroes patterns in the complex-A plane. Though A is hardly an adequate parameter to describe the moduli space of knots, the Mandelbrot-like structure is clearly seen — in full accord with the vision of hep-th/0501235, that concrete slicing of the Universal Mandelbrot set is not essential for revealing its structure. © 2015, The Author(s).","Chern-Simons Theories; Stochastic Processes; Topological Strings",,,"Springer Verlag",,,,,11266708,,,"English","J.

However, sex-related features of this process have not been characterized in sufficient detail. These distinctive features were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and neuropsychological examination. Seventy healthy subjects 21–48 years of age (36 men and 34 women) were involved in the study. During an fMRI experiment, the subjects had to shift their attention between two tasks (classifying figures according to their form or number). In neuropsychological examination participants completed a series of visual attention, task switching, and memory tests. The fMRI study revealed that a neuronal network controlling task switching in women includes the dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal cortical areas, as well as the secondary areas of the visual cortex in the left hemisphere (LH) and the right hemisphere (RH), and cortical areas of the left and right hemispheres of the cerebellum. The same areas were activated in men and additional sites of activation were detected in the supplementary motor area, right insula, and left thalamus. Comparison of the groups of men and women revealed significantly stronger activation of the prefrontal areas in both LH and RH, the left parietal lobe, and the right insula in men, and moreover activation of the supplementary motor area was observed in men but not in women. Neuropsychological testing showed that men took significantly more time to perform tasks requiring task switching, searching for stimuli, and arranging them. The data obtained indicate differences in the organization of visual task switching processes in men and women. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","attention switching; executive functions; fMRI; sex-related differences; task switching; visual stimuli",,,"Maik Nauka Publishing / Springer SBM",,,,,03621197,,,"English","Hum.

Magnetic responses evoked by repeated voluntary movements of the right index finger were studied in 18 healthy right-handed subjects. Finger movement periods were assessed using accelerometer signals. Continuous evoked brain magnetic activity recorded in the subjects throughout the experimental sessions was assembled into a single sequence which was then fragmented into independent components by independent components analysis and ranked in terms of the quantity of mutual information with the modified accelerometer signal. Averaging of the independent components demonstrating strongest links with finger movements was performed relative to the moment at which the movement started. Modeling of the distribution of the cerebral sources of the two independent components with the largest amounts of mutual information showed that their sources were located in the contralateral motor areas of the cortex, corresponding to anatomical markers of the hand representation area in the primary motor and primary somatosensory cortex.

The solitary waves of the same amplitude, “significant” duration, and different shapes are considered. For each geometry of a bay, parameterization of formulas is performed in order to eliminate the influence of the shape of waves approaching the shore on these formulas describing extreme wave run-up characteristics. The results obtained earlier for a plane beach and a parabolic beach are reproduced, and the new bay shapes (with a triangular cross section and with a cross-section profile varying proportionately to the coordinate in fourth and tenth degree) are considered. It is shown that in narrower bays the maximal run-up and run-down heights and the respective run-up and run-down velocities are higher than those in wider bays. At a run up of a solitary wave in a parabolic bay, run-up and run-down heights coincide, whereas in wider bays the run-up height exceeds the run-down height and in narrower bays, for example, in triangular ones, the opposite pattern (run-down height exceeds run-up height) is observed. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","bays of different cross sections; run-up of long waves on a coast; water waves; wave shape","shallow water; solitary wave; water wave; wave modeling; wave runup; wave velocity",,"Maik Nauka-Interperiodica Publishing",,,,,00014338,,,"English","Izv.

The leader was composed of the downward extending positive part and the upward extending negative part, these two parts (both branched, although in different ways) being connected by the single-channel middle part. The downward extending part included the tortuous positive leader channel (similar to its upward extending counterpart observed when the cloud polarity was negative) that was often accompanied by much less tortuous but often equally bright downward extending plasma formations of unknown nature. Very faint positive streamer zone was also observed. Either the positive leader channel or the unusual plasma formation (UPF) can come in contact with the grounded plane. The upward extending part is associated with a large network of faint channels, mostly fanning out of the upper part of the usually much brighter leader channel and apparently pervading the entire upper part of the cloud. Some of those faint channels could be unusually long and bright negative streamers, while others could be similar to UPFs. The IR luminosity along the brightest part of the bidirectional leader channel is often nonuniform. Some variations in channel brightness are localized and suggest the involvement of space leader-type processes at multiple positions along the channel, changes in channel orientation, or variations in channel radius. © 2015.

The evaluation is carried over such criteria as resource efficiency, noise tolerance and quality scores involving cardinality, density, coverage, and diversity of the patterns. An ideal triadic pattern is a totally dense maximal cuboid (formal triconcept). Relaxations of this notion under consideration are: OAC-triclusters; triclusters optimal with respect to the least-square criterion; and graph partitions obtained by using spectral clustering. We show that searching for an optimal tricluster cover is an NP-complete problem, whereas determining the number of such covers is #P-complete. Our extensive computational experiments lead us to a clear strategy for choosing a solution at a given dataset guided by the principle of Pareto-optimality according to the proposed criteria. © 2015, The Author(s).","Formal Concept Analysis; Multi-way set; Pattern mining; Suboptimal solutions; Triadic data; Triclustering; Tripartite graphs","Clustering algorithms; Computational complexity; Human computer interaction; Information analysis; Optimization; Pareto principle; Quality control; Multi-way set; Pattern mining; Suboptimal solution; Triadic data; Triclustering; Tripartite graphs; Formal concept analysis",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",,,,,08856125,,MALEE,"English","Mach Learn",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942368270

In this paper we introduce an alternative semi-probabilistic approach, which we call additive regularization of topic models (ARTM). Instead of building a purely probabilistic generative model of text we regularize an ill-posed problem of stochastic matrix factorization by maximizing a weighted sum of the log-likelihood and additional criteria. This approach enables us to combine probabilistic assumptions with linguistic and problem-specific requirements in a single multi-objective topic model. In the theoretical part of the work we derive the regularized EM-algorithm and provide a pool of regularizers, which can be applied together in any combination. We show that many models previously developed within Bayesian framework can be inferred easier within ARTM and in some cases generalized. In the experimental part we show that a combination of sparsing, smoothing, and decorrelation improves several quality measures at once with almost no loss of the likelihood. © 2014, The Author(s).","EM-algorithm; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Probabilistic latent sematic analysis; Probabilistic topic modeling; Regularization of ill-posed problems","Algorithms; Bayesian networks; Euler equations; Inference engines; Statistics; Stochastic systems; EM algorithms; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Probabilistic latent sematic analysis; Probabilistic topic models; Regularization of ill-posed problems; Stochastic models",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",,,,,08856125,,MALEE,"English","Mach Learn",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942369039

Such probability measures form an infinite-dimensional simplex, and the description of its extreme points (in other words, ergodic measures (Formula pressented.) was conjectured by Kerov in connection with nonnegative specializations of Hall–Littlewood symmetric functions. Vershik and Kerov also conjectured the following Law of Large Numbers. Consider an infinite random matrix drawn from an ergodic measure coming from the Kerov’s conjectural classification and its (Formula pressented.) submatrix formed by the first rows and columns. The sizes of Jordan blocks of the submatrix can be interpreted as a (random) partition of (Formula pressented.), or, equivalently, as a (random) Young diagram (Formula pressented.) with (Formula pressented.) boxes. Then, as (Formula pressented.), the rows and columns of (Formula pressented.) have almost sure limiting frequencies corresponding to parameters of this ergodic measure. Our main result is the proof of this Law of Large Numbers. We achieve it by analyzing a new randomized Robinson–Schensted–Knuth (RSK) insertion algorithm which samples random Young diagrams (Formula pressented.) coming from ergodic measures. The probability weights of these Young diagrams are expressed in terms of Hall–Littlewood symmetric functions. Our insertion algorithm is a modified and extended version of a recent construction by Borodin and Petrov (2013). On the other hand, our randomized RSK insertion generalizes a version of the RSK insertion introduced by Vershik and Kerov (SIAM J. Algebr. Discret.

We show that the algorithm provides a Bayes-risk consistent classifier. Furthermore, it is proved that the classifier converges at a rate which adapts to the unknown regularity of the intensity process.

Design/methodology/approach – The methodology included two stages: first, classifiers of place product uses and technologies were constructed on the basis of the product concept abstraction (Study 1) and then they were used as tools to systematize data about the attributes of city districts and the everyday activities of their residents to further identify product concepts (Study 2). Findings – Product concepts of five Moscow districts were formulated as sets of benefits or district uses (needs satisfied and activities encouraged) offered to residents. The concepts are expressed in terms of typical constructions but reflect the distinctive features and specificities of the districts. Research limitations/implications – Defining places as product concepts pushes the place product analysis, benefit and lifestyle segmentation forward. Additional place product dimensions and investigated places are advised to improve the reliability of the used classifiers as a tool for documentary research. Practical implications – The developed analytical procedure is a much-needed supplement to existing techniques used to shape the product strategies of places. Identifying contradictory uses helps make product decisions that are appropriate in concurrently supporting all these uses, including providing spatial differentiation of the place product. The study results are thus useful for the development of city master plans characterized by long planning horizons and a high degree of conceptualization. Originality/value – The paper proposes a new method for place product analysis that combines the advantages of both standardized and narrative approaches, introducing a convenient way to address the issue of clarity when transforming a variety of place attributes into core place values and eventual place brands. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Place benefit; Place product; Product concept; Product technology; Resident lifestyle; Typology",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,17538335,,,"English","J.

We propose an explanation for nonzero ""magic angles"" with 100% transmission for the case of symmetric potential barrier, as well as for their almost-survival for slightly asymmetric barrier in the bilayer graphene known previously from numerical simulations. Most importantly, we demonstrate that these magic angles are not protected in the case of bilayer and give an explicit example of a barrier with very small electron transmission probability for any angles. This means that one can lock charge carriers by a p-n-p (or n-p-n) junction without opening energy gap.

The article summarizes the results of recent foreign theoretical and empirical research on various aspects of labor mobility. Particular attention is paid to the research analyzing differences in dynamics of labor and job reallocations in developed and transitional economies. The cross-country comparative analysis provide a basis for several important conclusions. Firstly, despite signifi cant cross-country differences the dynamics of job reallocation in economies under transition exceeds on the whole those in developed countries. Secondly, the structure of the economy (manufacturing sector versus services) is one of the main factors determining both job and worker fl ows. Thirdly, there is an opposite relationship between the dynamics of job turnover and the size of enterprise. Small fi rms play a very important role in job creation, while large fi rms dominate in absolute numbers of jobs created. Fourthly, among the factors determining the differences in job and labor force dynamics institutional characteristics occupy an important place. This suggests that country-specifi c policies and institutions are likely to play an important role in determining the level of job and worker reallocation. Stringent employment protection for regular contracts is believed to have a statistically signifi cant negative effect on the workers' reallocation. Unemployment benefi ts' generosity appears to have a positive impact on average gross worker fl ows. By contrast, statutory minimum wages do not seem to have any sizeable effect on gross worker flows.","Job Turnover; Labor Market; Labor Mobility; Labor Turnover; Market Economies.; Reallocation; Transition Countries",,,"Primakov National Research Institute",,,,,01312227,,,"Russian","World Economy Int.

The basis of the study is uniquely empirical, obtained through a series of large-scale surveys among Russian producers and consumers of KIBS. The collected data provide quantitative evidence for the spatial dimension of the sector. Comparative analysis of the production and consumption of KIBS in Russia's federal districts makes it possible to classify the latter in terms of the exchange of related services and mapping of the intensity of their interregional supply and demand across federal districts. It is established that companies offering KIBS in Russia are largely concentrated in big cities. The demand for KIBS is more distributed, but not spatially neutral.

Like many other languages of the family, Archi shows a formal connection between logophoric and reflexive pronouns. The latter differs from the former in that it carries an obligatory intensifier particle. This connection questions the suggestion in Culy (1997); cf. also Dimmendaal (2001) to separate African-style 'pure' logophoric systems from systems where a long-distance reflexive is used in the same context. Culy (1997), in a typological analysis of logophoricity, argues that long-distance reflexives in logophoric contexts are a secondary extension of the reflexive function. Toldova (1999), in an overview of East Caucasian systems, suggests on the contrary that, in these languages, logophoricity is the primary function and the reflexive function is its extension. In their approaches, neither Culy nor Toldova rely on notions such as focus of empathy (Kuno, 1987), and Culy even explicitly disproves its relevance for the typology of logophoric systems. The solution suggested in the present study is discourse-based and is not unlike the focus of empathy. Both logophoric and reflexive uses of the Archi pronoun, corresponding to two clearly different and well established comparative concepts, constitute one descriptive category (Haspelmath, 2010). They both are extensions of the core function of the pronoun which is to mark the special pragmatic/discourse role of its referent - extensions that involve grammaticization of the pronoun in specific contexts as reflexives and logophoric. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Archi; East Caucasian languages; Logophoric pronouns; Reported speech",,,"Elsevier",,,,,03782166,,,"English","J.

Second, we find that the business diversification discount is related to the ownership structure and is due to the excess of the largest shareholders' control rights. Third, we find that the ownership diversification discount becomes a premium when the ownership diversification enables the control of the affiliated firms.

The samples were studied by a complex of methods (synchrotron radiation X-ray powder diffraction, high-resolution scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, absorption spectroscopy). The sequence of the added reagents effects the phase composition (anatase or mixtures of anatase and “η-TiO2”), size of crystallites, nanoparticles and agglomerates, manganese content, and oxidation state (Mn3+, Mn2+/Mn3+, or Mn3+/Mn4+). The Mn-doped TiO2 samples have been proven to have high photocatalytic activity for methyl orange (MO) under visible light. The rate of MO degradation reached 0.0046 min−1 (50 % in 150 min) for the sample containing a mixture of anatase (75 %) and “η-TiO2” (25 %) with a high degree of amorphism; the sample is characterized by the smallest size of crystallites (44.3 Å), the largest size of nanoparticles (33 nm) and agglomerates (10 μm), and the lowest manganese content (0.3 at. %) with the ratio Mn3+:Mn4+ = 1:1.

FTA practitioners have used frequently one or a suitable mixture of these methods for their activities. Changing policy and strategy making contexts as well as enabling technologies increased the need and possibility for performing adaptive Foresight studies in order to improve decision making about the future and using making better use of limited resources. This study performs a scientometric analysis of the publications in the major FTA journals with the aim of understanding the dynamics of using Foresight methods across time. Among the other branches of FTA, including forecasting, futures, and technology assessment, a special emphasis is given on Foresight as a systematic and inclusive way of exploring long term futures, developing visions and formulating policies for action. The study aims at detecting the key Trends and Weak Signals regarding the use of existing methods and emerging ones with potential uses for Foresight activities. Further implications will be achieved with the generation of networks for quantitative and qualitative methods. This will demonstrate the most frequently combined Foresight methods by researchers and practitioners. Where possible the methods will also be cross-fertilised with the key thematic areas to illustrate the relationships between policy domains and industrial sectors covered by the scope of study with methodological choice. This output is considered to be taken as a methodological guide for any researchers, practitioners or policy makers, who might embark upon or involved in a Foresight activity. Further outputs of the study will include the identification of centres of excellence in the use of Foresight methods and collaboration networks between countries, institutions and policy domains. Overall, the paper demonstrates how scientometric tools can be used to understand the dynamics of evolution in a research field. Thus, it provides an overview of the use of methods in Foresight, and how it is distinguished from the other FTA activities; the evolutionary characteristics of methodological design and factors influencing the choice of methods; and finally a discussion on the future potentials for new cutting-edge approaches. © 2015, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Foresight; Foresight methods; FTA; Scientometrics",,,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",,,,,01389130,,,"English","Scientometrics",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942980466

The one-day correlations ρ1 between w(t) and (Formula presented.) are computed within four-year sliding windows and are found to shift from negative to positive values near the end of Cycle 17 (∼1945). They remain positive during the last Grand Maximum and until ∼2009, when they fall to zero. We also identify a prominent regime change in ∼1915, strengthening previous evidence of major anomalies in solar activity at this date. We test an autoregressive process of order 1 (AR(1)) as a model that can reproduce the high-frequency component of ISSN: we compute ρ1 for this AR(1) process and find that it is negative. Positive values of ρ1 are found only if the process involves positive correlation: this leads us to suggest that the births of successive spots are positively correlated during the last Grand Maximum. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Auto-regressive process; First differences; Solar cycles; Sunspots",,,"Springer Netherlands",,,,,00380938,,,"English","Sol.

This is often viewed as a competitive process wherein a lexical representation is retrieved among semantically-related alternatives. The left prefrontal cortex (LPFC) is thought to help overcome competition for word selection through top-down control. However, whether the LPFC is always necessary for word selection remains unclear. We tested 6 LPFC-injured patients and controls in two picture naming paradigms varying in terms of item repetition. Both paradigms elicited the expected semantic interference effects (SIE), reflecting interference caused by semantically-related representations in word selection. However, LPFC patients as a group showed a larger SIE than controls only in the paradigm involving item repetition. We argue that item repetition increases interference caused by semantically-related alternatives, resulting in increased LPFC-dependent cognitive control demands. The remaining network of brain regions associated with word selection appears to be sufficient when items are not repeated. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..","Chronic stroke patients; Language production; Left prefrontal cortex; Proactive control; Semantic interference; Word selection","adult; Article; brain function; brain region; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; executive function; female; human; left prefrontal cortex; male; mental task; prefrontal cortex; response time; semantics; task performance; word selection; aged; cerebrovascular accident; middle aged; pathology; pathophysiology; photostimulation; physiology; prefrontal cortex; psychology; reaction time; repetition priming; semantics; verbal behavior; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Photic Stimulation; Prefrontal Cortex; Reaction Time; Repetition Priming; Semantics; Stroke; Verbal Behavior",,"Academic Press Inc.",,,,,0093934X,,BRLGA,"English","Brain Lang.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942303687

Previously, limited research suggested that the absolute number of deaths from stroke in women was greater than in men, but the incidence and mortality rates were greater in men. However, sex differences in various metrics of stroke burden on a global scale have not been a subject of comprehensive and comparable assessment for most regions of the world, nor have sex differences in stroke burden been examined for trends over time. Methods: Stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and healthy years lost due to disability were estimated as part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 Study. Data inputs included all available information on stroke incidence, prevalence and death and case fatality rates. Analysis was performed separately by sex and 5-year age categories for 188 countries. Statistical models were employed to produce globally comprehensive results over time. All rates were age-standardized to a global population and 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were computed. Findings: In 2013, global ischemic stroke (IS) and hemorrhagic stroke (HS) incidence (per 100,000) in men (IS 132.77 (95% UI 125.34-142.77); HS 64.89 (95% UI 59.82-68.85)) exceeded those of women (IS 98.85 (95% UI 92.11-106.62); HS 45.48 (95% UI 42.43-48.53)). IS incidence rates were lower in 2013 compared with 1990 rates for both sexes (1990 male IS incidence 147.40 (95% UI 137.87-157.66); 1990 female IS incidence 113.31 (95% UI 103.52-123.40)), but the only significant change in IS incidence was among women. © 2015 S.

Although age-standardized rates of stroke mortality have decreased worldwide in the past 2 decades, the absolute numbers of people who have a stroke every year, and live with the consequences of stroke or die from their stroke, are increasing. Regular updates on the current level of stroke burden are important for advancing our knowledge on stroke epidemiology and facilitate organization and planning of evidence-based stroke care. Objectives: This study aims to estimate incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years lived with disability (YLDs) and their trends for ischemic stroke (IS) and hemorrhagic stroke (HS) for 188 countries from 1990 to 2013. Methodology: Stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, DALYs and YLDs were estimated using all available data on mortality and stroke incidence, prevalence and excess mortality. Statistical models and country-level covariate data were employed, and all rates were age-standardized to a global population. All estimates were produced with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Results: In 2013, there were globally almost 25.7 million stroke survivors (71% with IS), 6.5 million deaths from stroke (51% died from IS), 113 million DALYs due to stroke (58% due to IS) and 10.3 million new strokes (67% IS). Over the 1990-2013 period, there was a significant increase in the absolute number of DALYs due to IS, and of deaths from IS and HS, survivors and incident events for both IS and HS. The preponderance of the burden of stroke continued to reside in developing countries, comprising 75.2% of deaths from stroke and 81.0% of stroke-related DALYs. Globally, the proportional contribution of stroke-related DALYs and deaths due to stroke compared to all diseases increased from 1990 (3.54% (95% UI 3.11-4.00) and 9.66% (95% UI 8.47-10.70), respectively) to 2013 (4.62% (95% UI 4.01-5.30) and 11.75% (95% UI 10.45-13.31), respectively), but there was a diverging trend in developed and developing countries with a significant increase in DALYs and deaths in developing countries, and no measurable change in the proportional contribution of DALYs and deaths from stroke in developed countries. Conclusion: Global stroke burden continues to increase globally. More efficient stroke prevention and management strategies are urgently needed to halt and eventually reverse the stroke pandemic, while universal access to organized stroke services should be a priority. © 2015 S.

Thomas Brutus finds himself at the intersection of real world and fantastic reality, which makes him horrified. But we can describe this situation in terms of political philosophy, like Hannah Arendt's concept of totalitarian society. It is not the reality of horror that deprives Thomas Brutus of the speaking ability and breaks his connection with the rest of society. Instead the society itself chooses not to confront obvious evil but to exclude the hero from its own ranks and to ignore his attempts to tell what is happening.","Exclusion.; Gogol; Horror; Responsibility",,,"Izdatel'stvo Nauka",,,,,00428744,,,"Russian","Vopsory Filosoffi",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029866421

In accommodating a broad diversity of nonprofit organizations with different religious and social backgrounds, the Netherlands created an elaborate mechanism for government–nonprofit collaboration in which nonprofit organizations fulfill functions in service delivery and policy formation. However, the sector is now fundamentally fragmented and has little shared identity left today. Paradoxically, its past success also makes it less likely that the Dutch nonprofit sector will be regarded as a solution to current social problems. © 2015, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.","Civil society; Corporatism; Human services; Partnership; Third sector","civil society; corporate strategy; government relations; nonprofit organization; partnership approach; public sector; Netherlands",,"Springer New York LLC",,,,,09578765,,VOLUE,"English","Voluntas",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946494221

Our numerical computations demonstrate the features of undular bore developing for different signs of the cubic nonlinear term. If cubic nonlinear term is negative, and initial wave amplitude is large enough, two undular bores are generated from the two breaking points formed on both crest slopes (within dispersionless Gardner equation). Undular bore consists of one table-top soliton and a group of small soliton-like waves passing through the table-top soliton. If the cubic nonlinear term is positive and again the wave amplitude is large enough, the breaking points appear on crest and trough generating groups of positive and negative soliton-like pulses. This is the main difference with respect to the classic Korteweg-de Vries equation, where the breaking point is single. It is shown also that nonlinear interaction of waves happens similarly to one of scenarios of two-soliton interaction of ""exchange"" or ""overtake"" types with a phase shift. If small-amplitude pulses interact with large-amplitude soliton-like pulses, their speed in average is negative in the case when ""free"" velocity is positive. Nonlinear interaction leads to the generation of higher harmonics and spectrum width increases with amplitude increase independently of the sign of cubic nonlinear term. The breaking asymptotic k4/3 predicted within the dispersionless Gardner equation emerges during the process of undular bore development. The formation of soliton-like perturbations leads to appearance of several spectral peaks which are downshifting with time. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Soliton interaction; Table-top soliton; Undular bore","Mathematical transformations; Nonlinear equations; Phase shift; Phase shifters; Solitons; Extended versions; Gardner equations; Internal tidal waves; Nonlinear interactions; Numerical computations; Soliton interactions; Table-top; Undular bore; Korteweg-de Vries equation",,"Elsevier",,,,,01672789,,PDNPD,"English","Phys D Nonlinear Phenom",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955282886

These are adaptive process frameworks adjustable to software product size and scope. They usually include a set of methods, principles and techniques, and software development tools. Each of the methodologies can implement any of the lifecycle models. We discuss the difference between formal and agile methodologies. The formal methodologies include more artifacts; they have a rich set of complex processes, which include larger workflows and smaller activities. For each activity, every role assigned to it produces a deliverable. In crisis conditions, such as hardly formalizable problems, rapidly changing requirements and other uncertainties, agile methodologies, which are more adaptive and flexible in terms of artifacts, are applicable. The agile methodologies rely on self-disciplined and self-manageable teams, and consequently they are more constrained in terms of human-related factors. Similar to lifecycle models, there is no “silver bullet” in software development methodologies. Due to rigorous processes and more artifacts, formal methodologies are suitable for large-scale product development. Agile methodologies require special techniques and high level of discipline; otherwise, they can likely result in a low quality of software production. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Agile methodology; Formal methodology; Software development methodology","Formal methods; Life cycle; Software design; Agile Methodologies; Complex Processes; Formal methodology; Large-scale products; Software development methodologies; Software development tools; Software methodologies; Software products; Software engineering",,"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",,,,,21903018,,,"English","Smart Innov.

In particular, we show that the secular growth of the loop corrections to the two-point correlation functions is gauge independent: we observe the same growth in the case of the static gauge for the constant background electric field. Furthermore we solve the kinetic equation describing photon production from the background fields, which was derived in our previous paper and allows one to sum up leading secularly growing corrections from all loops. Finally, we show that in the constant electric field background the one-loop correction to the current of the produced pairs is not zero: it also grows with time and violates time translational and reversal invariance of QED on the constant electric field background. © 2015, The Author(s).","Anomalies in Field and String Theories; Nonperturbative Effects; Renormalization Group",,,"Springer Verlag",,,,,11266708,,,"English","J.

The research is based on the data from two surveys of manufacturing companies performed in 2005 and 2009. The findings show beneficial effects of importing on innovation. Previous involvement in the importation of equipment and intermediates leads to future innovation, and there is evidence of simultaneous choice in favour of imports and innovation in case of manufacturing equipment. The learning effects from importing seem to be higher for product than for process innovation. The decisions of firms to invest in innovation and to import are sensitive to their location, technology position, pressure from import competition, and their efforts to conduct R&D in addition to importing embodied knowledge. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg",,,,"Springer Verlag",,,,,05701864,,,"English","Ann.

In the current literature the image of “Russian sociology” remains fragmentary and incomplete. Different stages in the history of Russian sociology are usually considered as mutually antagonistic. We challenge this view by arguing that the Russian sociological tradition can be seen as a continuing trajectory of social thought development, lasting from the XIXth century until present days and unified by a set of underlying historically determined common features: publicism (an orientation to non-academic audiences and a desire to promote changes in the real world); moral and ethical concern (a clear expression of value orientations; the particular importance of ethical and moral issues); problem orientation (a focus on urgent social concerns with “problem” dominating over “method” in sociological research). We demonstrate the importance of these features for a better understanding of the perspectives and contributions of Russian sociologists to current international debates. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Methodology; Public sociology; Russian history; Russian sociology",,,"Transaction Publishers",,,,,00031232,,,"English","Am.

Next, it outlines the key policy measures affecting nonprofit organizations (NPOs) put in place by the Russian government beginning in the latter part of the first decade of the 21st century. Unlike some accounts, however, this one brings into focus both the interesting “tool box” of support programs for NPOs enacted during this period as well as the more restrictive regulatory measures, such as the “foreign agents law,” that also came into force. Finally, the article seeks to unravel the puzzle posed by these apparently competing realities of Russian government policy toward nonprofit organizations by bringing to bear the conceptual lenses that Graham Allison formulated to make sense of the strange series of actions that surrounded the Cuban Missile Crisis a little over 50 years ago. © 2015, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.","Government regulation; Nonprofit sector; Public administration; Public–private partnership; Russia; Social policy; Socially oriented NPO","governance approach; nonprofit organization; policy approach; public administration; public-private partnership; regulatory framework; social policy; Russian Federation",,"Springer New York LLC",,,,,09578765,,VOLUE,"English","Voluntas",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946495767

For a number of membrane receptors, a modulation of TM domains' oligomerization has been shown to contribute to the development of severe pathological states, thus calling for detailed studies of the atomistic aspects of the process. Despite considerable progress achieved so far, several crucial questions still remain: How do the helices recognize each other in the membrane? What is the driving force of their association? Here, we assess the dimerization free energy of TM helices along with a careful consideration of the interplay between the structure and dynamics of protein and lipids using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in the hydrated lipid bilayer for three different model systems - TM fragments of glycophorin A, polyalanine and polyleucine peptides. We observe that the membrane driven association of TM helices exhibits a prominent entropic character, which depends on the peptide sequence. Thus, a single TM peptide of a given composition induces strong and characteristic perturbations in the hydrophobic core of the bilayer, which may facilitate the initial ""communication"" between TM helices even at the distances of 20-30 Å. Upon tight helix-helix association, the immobilized lipids accommodate near the peripheral surfaces of the dimer, thus disturbing the packing of the surrounding. The dimerization free energy of the modeled peptides corresponds to the strength of their interactions with lipids inside the membrane being the lowest for glycophorin A and similarly higher for both homopolymers. We propose that the ability to accommodate lipid tails determines the dimerization strength of TM peptides and that the lipid matrix directly governs their association. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"glycophorin; lipid; lipid bilayer; peptide; polyalanine; polyleucine; protein binding; chemistry; lipid bilayer; molecular dynamics; thermodynamics; Glycophorin; Lipid Bilayers; Lipids; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Peptides; Protein Binding; Thermodynamics",,"American Chemical Society",,,,,15499618,,JCTCC,"English","J.

Found experimental results for all studied wavelengths can be explained by the vortex hot spot model (which assumes partial suppression of Δ in the area with size smaller than the width of the nanowire) if one takes into account nucleation and entrance of the vortices to the photon induced hot spot and their pinning by the hot spot with relatively large size and strongly suppressed Δ. © 2015 American Physical Society.",,,,"American Physical Society",,,,,10980121,,PRBMD,"English","Phys.

Currently developed innovative decision support systems (DSS) aim to achieve optimum results while minimizing the risks of serious losses. The purpose of the DSS is to help the decision-maker facing the problem of huge amounts of data and ambiguous reactions of complicated systems depending on external factors. By means of accurate and profound analysis, DSSs are expected to provide the user with precisely forecasted indicators and optimal decisions. In this paper we suggest a new DSS structure which could be used in a wide range of difficult to formalize tasks and achieve a high speed of calculation and decision-making. We examine different approaches to determining the dependence of a target variable on input data and review the most common statistical forecasting methods. The advantages of using neural networks for this purpose are described. We suggest applying interval neural networks for calculations with underdetermined (interval) data, which makes it possible to use our DSS in a wide range of complicated tasks. We developed a corresponding learning algorithm for the interval neural networks. The advantages of using a genetic algorithm (GA) to select the most significant inputs are shown. We justify the use of general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) to achieve high-speed calculations with the decision support system in question. A functional diagram of the system is presented and described. The results and samples of the DSS application are demonstrated. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The level of violent corporate raiding is connected to the economic appeal of the region and its capacity to implement raiding due to the rent-orientation of regional law enforcement.

Our main observation is that the homotopy invariant version of cardinality is the covering number of Shelah’s PCF theory, and that other combinatorial objects, such as Shelah’s revised power function—the cardinal function featuring in Shelah’s revised GCH theorem—can be obtained using similar tools.

On the one hand, it is a never-ceasing upgrading of the SC electronics to lower energy consumption and increase its functionality, which in turn makes it more susceptible to electrostatic discharges (ESDs). On the other hand, designers constantly seek to improve electronics protection against ESDs. Spectr-R SC features on-board equipment, which is highly sensitive to possible ESDs. To exclude ESD-related failures, the following protection measures have been taken. Based on the Satellite-MIEM computer code, we developed the lumped-element model of the Spectr-R body currents and cable-affected electronic response. This model made it possible to compute SC body currents initiated by ESDs originating at various structural sites. For various cable harnesses, we measured transformation coefficients converting body currents into the amplitude of the noise voltages appearing in a cable (a patented methodology was used for this purpose). Afterward, these transformation coefficients together with the ESD-induced currents have been fed into the Satellite-MIEM software to compute noise voltages appearing in electronic input circuits, connected via these cables to the satellite exterior surface. Comparing protection efficiency of cables and electronic equipment allowed us to select suitable cable harnesses and the appropriate equipment protection to insure reliable in-flight performance of the space vehicle. From the launch in July 2011 and up to the present time, there were no failures of the Spectr-R electronics, which could be traced to ESDs. © 2015 IEEE.","Electrostatic discharges (ESDs); lumped-element model (LEM); protection; spacecraft (SC) Spektr-R","Automobile bodies; Automobile electronic equipment; Cables; Electronic equipment; Electrostatic devices; Electrostatic discharge; Energy utilization; Equipment; Oscillators (electronic); Satellites; Equipment protection; Exterior surfaces; In-flight performance; Lumped element model; On board equipments; Protection efficiency; Protection measures; Transformation coefficients; Spacecraft",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,00933813,,ITPSB,"English","IEEE Trans Plasma Sci",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957844396

Depending on the system parameters, we find cases of regular (in particular, integrable) behavior and detect various attracting sets (including strange attractors) that are typical of dissipative systems. We construct a chart of regimes with regions characterizing chaotic and regular regimes depending on the degree of conservativeness. We examine in detail the effect of reversal, which was observed previously in the motion of rattlebacks. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","nonholonomic constraint; reversal; strange attractor; Suslov problem",,,"Maik Nauka Publishing / Springer SBM",,,,,15603547,,,"English","Regul.

However, its neurobiological foundations remain largely unknown. In an electrophysiological study optimally designed to probe this rapid formation of new word memory circuits, we employed acoustically controlled novel word-forms incorporating native and non-native speech sounds, while manipulating the subjects' attention on the input. We found a robust index of neurolexical memory-trace formation: a rapid enhancement of the brain's activation elicited by novel words during a short (~ 30 min) perceptual exposure, underpinned by fronto-temporal cortical networks, and, importantly, correlated with behavioural learning outcomes. Crucially, this neural memory trace build-up took place regardless of focused attention on the input or any pre-existing or learnt semantics. Furthermore, it was found only for stimuli with native-language phonology, but not for acoustically closely matching non-native words. These findings demonstrate a specialised cortical mechanism for rapid, automatic and phonology-dependent formation of neural word memory circuits. © 2015.","Electroencephalography; Event-related potentials; Language learning; Plasticity; Speech","adult; Article; attention; auditory stimulation; behavior; brain cortex; brain electrophysiology; evoked auditory response; female; human; human experiment; inferior frontal cortex; language ability; left posterior middle temporal cortex; male; neocortex; normal human; phonetics; priority journal; semantic memory; signal detection; speech; word recognition; electroencephalography; frontal lobe; learning; neocortex; physiology; recall; recognition; speech perception; temporal lobe; young adult; Adult; Attention; Electroencephalography; Female; Frontal Lobe; Humans; Learning; Male; Mental Recall; Neocortex; Recognition (Psychology); Speech Perception; Temporal Lobe; Young Adult",,"Academic Press Inc.",,,,,10538119,,NEIME,"English","NeuroImage",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84934972058

The energy equal to E = V P is also less than zero. Therefore, it is natural to introduce a negative relative temperature as the mean energy. The negative pressure on the negative spinodal tends to minus infinity as Tr → 0. Accordingly, the negative relative temperature will also approach minus infinity. As the chemical potential μ→−∞, μ/T → 0, the asymptotic behavior of the thermodynamic quantities gives rise to amebas of special form in tropical (idempotent) analysis.

However, there is much uncertainty about the processes that connect diversity variables with personal outcomes. In this paper, we are particularly interested in different levels of coalitional affiliation, which refers to people's social allegiances that guide their expectations of social support, in-group strength and cohesion. We operationalize coalitional affiliation as the extent to which people rely on a homogeneous social network, and we measure it with indicators of friendships across ethnic boundaries and frequency of contact with friends. Using multi-level models and data from the European Social Survey (Round 1, 2002-2003) for 19 countries, we demonstrate that coalitional affiliation provides an empirically reliable, as well as theoretically coherent, explanation for various effects of ethnic/racial diversity. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Coalitional psychology; Ethnic diversity; Health; Well-being","ancestry group; cultural diversity; demography; ethnic group; Europe; female; friend; health; human; human relation; male; minority group; questionnaire; social network; social support; trust; Continental Population Groups; Cultural Diversity; Ethnic Groups; Europe; Female; Friends; Health; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Minority Groups; Residence Characteristics; Social Networking; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires; Trust",,"Academic Press Inc.",,,,,0049089X,,SSREB,"English","Soc.

Due to the convenience of image processing software (e.g., FreeSurfer), standard practice is to rely on automated results without performing visual inspection of intermediate processing. In this work, structural MRIs of 40 healthy controls who were scanned twice were used to determine the test-retest reliability of FreeSurfer-derived cortical measures in four groups of subjects-those 25 that passed visual inspection (approved), those 15 that failed visual inspection (disapproved), a combined group, and a subset of 10 subjects (Travel) whose test and retest scans occurred at different sites. Test-retest correlation (TRC), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and percent difference (PD) were used to measure the reliability in the Destrieux and Desikan-Killiany (DK) atlases. In the approved subjects, reliability of cortical thickness/surface area/volume (DK atlas only) were: TRC (0.82/0.88/0.88), ICC (0.81/0.87/0.88), PD (0.86/1.19/1.39), which represent a significant improvement over these measures when disapproved subjects are included. Travel subjects' results show that cortical thickness reliability is more sensitive to site differences than the cortical surface area and volume. To determine the effect of visual inspection on sample size required for studies of MRI-derived cortical thickness, the number of subjects required to show group differences was calculated. Significant differences observed across imaging sites, between visually approved/disapproved subjects, and across regions with different sizes suggest that these measures should be used with caution. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Cerebral cortical surface area; Cerebral cortical thickness; Cerebral cortical volume; FreeSurfer; Multisite MRI; Test-retest reliability","adult; aged; Article; brain cortex; brain size; computer program; cortical thickness (brain); human; human experiment; imaging software; measurement; neuroimaging; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; test retest reliability; adolescent; anatomy and histology; automated pattern recognition; evaluation study; image processing; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; procedures; reproducibility; software; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cerebral Cortex; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Young Adult",,"John Wiley and Sons Inc.",,,,,10659471,,HBMAE,"English","Hum.

(J Symb Log 70(2):515–535, 2005) gave a complexity characterization of 2-random sequences in terms of plain Kolmogorov complexity $${C(\cdot)}$$C(·) : they are sequences that have infinitely many initial segments with O(1)-maximal plain complexity (among the strings of the same length). Later Miller (Notre Dame J Form Log 50(4):381–391, 2009) showed that prefix complexity $${K(\cdot)}$$K(·) can also be used in a similar way: a sequence is 2-random if and only if it has infinitely many initial segments with O(1)-maximal prefix complexity (which is n + K(n) for strings of length n). The known proofs of these results are quite involved; in this paper we provide elementary proofs. Miller (J Symb Log 69(3):907–913, 2004, http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jsl/1096901774) also gave a quantitative version of the first result: the $${\mathbf{0}'}$$0′-randomness deficiency of a sequence $${\omega}$$ω equals lim inf$${_n [n - C(\omega_1\dots\omega_n)] + O(1)}$$n[n-C(ω1⋯ωn)]+O(1). Our simplified proof can also be used to prove this. We show (and this seems to be a new result) that a similar quantitative result is also true for prefix complexity: $${\mathbf{0}'}$$0′-randomness deficiency equals lim inf$${_n [n + KP(n) - K(\omega_1\dots\omega_n)]+ O(1)}$$n[n+KP(n)-K(ω1⋯ωn)]+O(1). © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2-randomness; Computableanalysis; Kolmogorov complexity; Martin–Löf randomness; Randomness deficiency",,,"Springer New York LLC",,,,,09335846,,,"English","Arch.

In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), we estimated these quantities for acute and chronic diseases and injuries for 188 countries between 1990 and 2013. Methods Estimates were calculated for disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and YLDs using GBD 2010 methods with some important refinements. Results for incidence of acute disorders and prevalence of chronic disorders are new additions to the analysis. Key improvements include expansion to the cause and sequelae list, updated systematic reviews, use of detailed injury codes, improvements to the Bayesian meta-regression method (DisMod-MR), and use of severity splits for various causes. An index of data representativeness, showing data availability, was calculated for each cause and impairment during three periods globally and at the country level for 2013. In total, 35 620 distinct sources of data were used and documented to calculated estimates for 301 diseases and injuries and 2337 sequelae. The comorbidity simulation provides estimates for the number of sequelae, concurrently, by individuals by country, year, age, and sex. Disability weights were updated with the addition of new population-based survey data from four countries. Findings Disease and injury were highly prevalent; only a small fraction of individuals had no sequelae. Comorbidity rose substantially with age and in absolute terms from 1990 to 2013. Incidence of acute sequelae were predominantly infectious diseases and short-term injuries, with over 2 billion cases of upper respiratory infections and diarrhoeal disease episodes in 2013, with the notable exception of tooth pain due to permanent caries with more than 200 million incident cases in 2013. Conversely, leading chronic sequelae were largely attributable to non-communicable diseases, with prevalence estimates for asymptomatic permanent caries and tension-type headache of 2·4 billion and 1·6 billion, respectively. The distribution of the number of sequelae in populations varied widely across regions, with an expected relation between age and disease prevalence. YLDs for both sexes increased from 537·6 million in 1990 to 764·8 million in 2013 due to population growth and ageing, whereas the age-standardised rate decreased little from 114·87 per 1000 people to 110·31 per 1000 people between 1990 and 2013. Leading causes of YLDs included low back pain and major depressive disorder among the top ten causes of YLDs in every country. YLD rates per person, by major cause groups, indicated the main drivers of increases were due to musculoskeletal, mental, and substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and chronic respiratory diseases; however HIV/AIDS was a notable driver of increasing YLDs in sub-Saharan Africa. Also, the proportion of disability-adjusted life years due to YLDs increased globally from 21·1% in 1990 to 31·2% in 2013. Interpretation Ageing of the world's population is leading to a substantial increase in the numbers of individuals with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Rates of YLDs are declining much more slowly than mortality rates. The non-fatal dimensions of disease and injury will require more and more attention from health systems. The transition to non-fatal outcomes as the dominant source of burden of disease is occurring rapidly outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Our results can guide future health initiatives through examination of epidemiological trends and a better understanding of variation across countries. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"acute disease; acute hepatitis A; acute hepatitis B; acute otitis media; Africa south of the Sahara; anemia; Article; bacterial skin disease; biliary tract disease; burn; cataract; Chagas disease; chickenpox; chlamydiasis; chronic disease; chronic kidney disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; chronic respiratory tract disease; communicable disease; comorbidity; congenital disorder; dengue; dental caries; developed country; developing country; diabetes mellitus; diarrhea; digestive system disease; disability; genital herpes; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; gonorrhea; heart disease; hemolytic anemia; hepatitis C; hepatitis E; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hypertension; incidence; injury; intellectual impairment; interstitial nephritis; iron deficiency anemia; ischemic heart disease; low back pain; lower respiratory tract infection; major depression; malaria; malignant neoplastic disease; maternal hypertension; mortality; musculoskeletal disease; neurologic disease; newborn disease; non communicable disease; osteoarthritis; otitis media; ovary polycystic disease; pelvic organ prolapse; periodontal disease; population growth; premenstrual syndrome; prevalence; priority journal; puerperal infection; refraction error; rheumatoid arthritis; schistosomiasis; sickle cell trait; simulation; substance abuse; systematic review (topic); tension headache; thalassemia; tooth pain; traffic accident; trichomoniasis; tropical disease; typhoid fever; upper respiratory tract infection; urinary tract infection; uterus myoma; visual impairment; acute disease; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; child; chronic disease; cost of illness; demography; disabled person; female; health; infant; male; middle aged; Neglected Diseases; newborn; preschool child; sex ratio; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Wounds and Injuries; young adult; Acute Disease; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Chronic Disease; Cost of Illness; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Disabled Persons; Female; Global Health; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Neglected Diseases; Prevalence; Residence Characteristics; Sex Distribution; Wounds and Injuries; Young Adult",,"Lancet Publishing Group",,,,,01406736,,LANCA,"English","Lancet",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940447040

Recent works consider processing policies for buffers that hold packets with different processing requirement (number of processing cycles needed before a packet can be transmitted out) but uniform value, aiming to maximize the throughput, i.e., the number of transmitted packets. Other developments deal with packets of varying value but uniform processing requirement (each packet requires one processing cycle); the objective here is to maximize the total transmitted value. In this work, we consider a more general problem, combining packets with both nonuniform processing and nonuniform values in the same queue. We study the properties of various processing orders in this setting. We show that in the general case natural processing policies have poor performance guarantees, with linear lower bounds on their competitive ratio. Moreover, we show an adversarial lower bound that holds for every online policy. On the positive side, in the special case when only two different values are allowed, 1 and V, we present a policy that achieves competitive ratio (1 + W+2/V), where W is the maximal number of required processing cycles. We also consider copying costs during admission. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Competitive ratio; Heterogeneous traffic; Network element; Poor performance; Positive sides; Priority queueing; Processing cycles; Uniform values; Telecommunication networks","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","34th IEEE Annual Conference on Computer Communications and Networks, IEEE INFOCOM 2015","26 April 2015 through 1 May 2015",,116955,0743166X,9781479983810,PINFE,"English","Proc IEEE INFOCOM",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954230234

Many of them are linear, i.e., lack disulfide bonds. When isolated from the venom, or obtained by other means, these peptides exhibit common properties. They are cationic; being mostly disordered in aqueous solution, assume amphiphilic α-helical structure in contact with lipid membranes; and exhibit general cytotoxicity, including antifungal, antimicrobial, hemolytic, and anticancer activities. To suit the pharmacological needs, the activity spectrum of these peptides should be modified by rational engineering. As an example, we provide a detailed review on latarcins (Ltc), linear cytolytic peptides from Lachesana tarabaevi spider venom. Diverse experimental and computational techniques were used to investigate the spatial structure of Ltc in membrane-mimicking environments and their effects on model lipid bilayers. The antibacterial activity of Ltc was studied against a panel of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, the action of Ltc on erythrocytes and cancer cells was investigated in detail with confocal laser scanning microscopy. In the present review, we give a critical account of the progress in the research of Ltc. We explore the relationship between Ltc structure and their biological activity and derive molecular characteristics, which can be used for optimization of other linear peptides. Current applications of Ltc and prospective use of similar membrane-active peptides are outlined. © 2015 Springer Basel.","Antimicrobial peptide; Biologically active compounds; Correlation analysis; Cytolytic toxin; Mechanism of action; Structure-function relationship","antiinfective agent; antineoplastic agent; hemolytic agent; latarcin; spider venom; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; antimicrobial cationic peptide; antineoplastic agent; hemolytic agent; latarcin 2a, Lachesana tarabaevi; peptide; spider venom; antibacterial activity; antineoplastic activity; confocal laser microscopy; drug determination; drug effect; drug mechanism; drug response; drug structure; drug synthesis; growth inhibition; hemolysis; human; Lachesana tarabaevi; membrane structure; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; Review; spider; amino acid sequence; animal; cell membrane; chemistry; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbial sensitivity test; molecular genetics; protein secondary structure; structure activity relation; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Membrane; Hemolytic Agents; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Molecular Sequence Data; Peptides; Protein Structure, Secondary; Spider Venoms; Structure-Activity Relationship",,"Birkhauser Verlag AG",,,,,1420682X,,CMLSF,"English","Cell.

Three studies examined whether the distinction between benign and malicious envy can resolve this inconsistency. We found that malicious envy is related to schadenfreude, while benign envy is not. This result held both in the Netherlands where benign and malicious envy are indicated by separate words (Study 1: Sample A, N = 139; Sample B, N = 150), and in the USA where a single word is used to denote both types (Study 2, N = 180; Study 3, N = 349). Moreover, the effect of malicious envy on schadenfreude was independent of other antecedents of schadenfreude (such as feelings of inferiority, disliking the target person, anger, and perceived deservedness). These findings improve our understanding of the antecedents of schadenfreude and help reconcile seemingly contradictory findings on the relationship between envy and schadenfreude. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Benign envy; Deservedness; Envy; Malicious envy; Schadenfreude; Social comparison","adult; anger; Article; benign envy; deservedness; dislike; emotion; female; human; inferiority; male; malicious envy; Netherlands; priority journal; resentment; schadenfreude; United States; adolescent; middle aged; social behavior; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Netherlands; Social Behavior; United States; Young Adult",,"Routledge",,,,,02699931,,COEME,"English","Cogn.

In classical vehicle routing problems (VRP), each vehicle can perform only one trip. Because of the high investment costs of additional vehicles, organizations allow the vehicles to perform multiple trips as in multi-trip vehicle routing problems (MTVRP), which reflects the real requirements better than the classical VRP. This study contributes to the literature by using a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation and a simulated annealing (SA) based solution methodology for CumMTVRP-LD, which considers the minimization of fuel consumption as the objective function. According to preliminary computational results using benchmark problems in the literature, the proposed methodology obtained promising results in terms of solution quality and computational time. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","CO 2 Emissions; Heuristic approaches; Mixed integer programming; Multi-trip vehicle routing problem; Simulated annealing",,,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",,,,,14202026,,,"English","Environ.

Instead, we study the case in which the central bank controls the risky interest rate to minimize the probability of default while ruling out large inflation hikes. We show that this policy regime can mitigate default risks only when the central bank is expected to allow sufficient increases in inflation. When agents believe that the central bank's tolerance toward inflation hikes has increased, equilibrium risk premium goes down, suggesting that information concerning changes in the central bank's preferences over inflation directly impacts default risks. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Default; FTPL; Inflation; Monetary policy; Sovereign debt",,,"Elsevier",,,,,02649993,,,"English","Econ.

The article focuses on Russia-ASEAN trade. The author applies innovative methods of measuring trade in value added terms in order to capture the unobserved bilateral linkages behind the offi cially recorded trade fl ows. First, customs and balance of payments sources of bilateral trade data are briefl y reviewed. For user, there are at least two inherent problems in those data: the inconsistencies in ""mirror trade fl ows and the attribution of the origin of a traded product wholly to the exporting country. This results in large discrepancies between Russian and ASEAN ""mirror trade data and, arguably, their low importance as each other's trade partners. Next, the author explores new data from inter-country input-output tables that necessarily reconcile bilateral differences and offer greater detail about the national and sectoral origin or destination of traded goods and services. Relevant data are derived from the OECD-WTO TiVA database and are rearranged to obtain various estimates of Russia-ASEAN trade in value added in 2009. The main fi nding is that sizable amount of the value added of Russian origin is embodied in third countries' exports to ASEAN members and ASEAN members' exports to third countries. As a result, the cumulative fl ow of Russia's value added to ASEAN members is estimated to be 62% larger than the direct gross exports, whereas for China and South Korea it is, respectively, 21% and 23% smaller. The indirect, unobserved value added fl ows can be largely explained by the use of Russian energy resources, chemicals and metals as imported inputs in third countries (China, South Korea) and ASEAN members' own production. The contribution of these inputs is then accumulated along the value chain. Finally, the most important sectoral value chains are visualized for readers' convenience. So far, it's apparent that Russia is linked to ASEAN countries through intricate production networks and indirectly contributes to their trade with third countries.","ASEAN; Global value chains; Input-output tables; International trade; Russia; Statistics; Trade; Value added",,,"Primakov National Research Institute",,,,,01312227,,,"Russian","World Economy Int.

The authors control for the unrelated diversification when the firm has different business segments in different sectors. Design/methodology/approachThe authors analyze a sample of Chilean-listed firms between 2005 and 2009, in two stages. First, the authors compute the diversification premium or discount, defined as the part of the firms’ capitalization that stems from the diversification strategy. Then, the authors regress the premium or discount against the business and ownership diversification measures and other control variables. FindingsIn addition to a discount for unrelated business diversification, the authors find an ownership diversification discount when non-financial firms are shareholders of other firms. However, this discount turns into a premium when the firm gains the control of the owned firm, especially in related sectors. Originality/valueThe authors pioneer the analysis of the ownership diversification in Latin American firms. The results apply not only to Chile but also to a number of Latin American countries since many of these countries have, in common with Chile, a concentrated corporate ownership structure and a weak protection of investors’ rights. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Chilean firms; Emerging Latin American markets; Firm value; Ownership participation; Unrelated diversification",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,10128255,,,"English","Academia Revista Latinoamericana de Administracion",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84976534286

The analysis considers whether making one of the contribution options salient, either through its merits or by arbitrarily choosing one to feature during the experiment, helps overcome the increased coordination problem.

DA neurons display a range of activity modes that vary in frequency and degree of burst firing. Importantly, DA neuronal bursting is associated with a significantly greater degree of DA release than an equivalent tonic activity pattern. Here, we introduce a single compartmental, conductance-based computational model for DA cell activity that captures the behavior of DA neuronal dynamics and examine the multiple factors that underlie DA firing modes: the strength of the SK conductance, the amount of drive, and GABA inhibition. Our results suggest that neurons with low SK conductance fire in a fast firing mode, are correlated with burst firing, and require higher levels of applied current before undergoing depolarization block. We go on to consider the role of GABAergic inhibition on an ensemble of dynamical classes of DA neurons and find that strong GABA inhibition suppresses burst firing. Our studies suggest differences in the distribution of the SK conductance and GABA inhibition levels may indicate subclasses of DA neurons within the VTA. We further identify, that by considering alternate potassium dynamics, the dynamics display burst patterns that terminate via depolarization block, akin to those observed in vivo in VTA DA neurons and in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) DA cell preparations under apamin application. In addition, we consider the generation of transient burst firing events that are NMDA-initiated or elicited by a sudden decrease of GABA inhibition, that is, disinhibition. © 2015 Oster, Faure and Gutkin.","Bursting; Dopamine; GABA; Modeling; NMDA; Regular firing; SK channel; VTA","Amines; Depolarization; Dynamics; Models; Neural networks; Neurophysiology; Bursting; Dopamine; GABA; NMDA; Regular firing; SK channel; VTA; Neurons; 4 aminobutyric acid receptor; AMPA receptor; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; Article; cell activity; cell function; compartment model; controlled study; dopamine release; dopaminergic nerve cell; dopaminergic transmission; glutamatergic synapse; mathematical computing; mesencephalon; midbrain ventral segmental area; molecular dynamics; nerve cell membrane conductance; nerve cell membrane steady potential; nerve cell stimulation; spike; substantia nigra pars compacta",,"Frontiers Research Foundation",,,,,16625188,,,"English","Front.

The goal is to highlight how the use of information and communication technology contributed to the development of democratic practices in Russia. His westernized, grassroots political campaign was a novelty in the country, involving online fundraising, door-to-door canvassing, engagement of volunteers, digital projects, and meetings with voters, for instance. The argument is that, although Navalny lost the election, his candidacy represented advancement in terms of both the use of new media and the promotion of democratic development in the midst of autocratic Russia. If the progress will be maintained, it remains to be seen. The theoretical framework includes the reality of the Russian political scenario and the conceptualization of transmedia storytelling strategies in the context of participatory politics.

It is demonstrated that tellurium films on (001) muscovite substrates are more homogeneous and can be detached from the substrate, which makes them interesting for carrying out experiments on epitaxy of CdTe films. Tellurium films on sapphire are more heterogeneous and mosaic; however, their growth is accompanied by the formation of hexagonal tellurium microtubes with a high aspect ratio: a diameter of ~1–10 μm and a length of ~1–10 mm. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",,"Aspect ratio; Cadmium telluride; Chemical vapor deposition; Epitaxial growth; Mica; Sapphire; Tellurium; Tellurium compounds; CdTe; Different substrates; High aspect ratio; Micro-tubes; Muscovite substrates; Sapphire substrates; Thermochemical activation; Vapor Phase; Substrates",,"Maik Nauka-Interperiodica Publishing",,,,,10637745,,,"English","Crystallogr.

We explore the possibility to increase the recognition rate by requiring the speaker to put the stress on all vowels in a command. We propose the novel modification of our fuzzy phonetic decoding method, in which each vowel is put in correspondence with a fuzzy union of sets of available reference signals from this class. A first, syllables are detected and phoneme segmentation is performed. Secondly, the command is extracted from spontaneous speech by thresholding the ratio of the duration of homogeneous segments to the duration of the whole syllable. Finally, each syllable is put in correspondence with the fuzzy set of vowels, and commands are ordered based on similarity with the fuzzy set of the utterance. The experimental results in synthetic and real Russian datasets prove that our method is characterized by better accuracy in comparison with known recognition methods. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Fuzzy phonetic decoding; Isolated words recognition; Kullback-Leibler divergence; Signal processing; Voice control","Control systems; Decoding; Disease control; Fuzzy sets; Linguistics; Signal processing; Decoding methods; Isolated words; Kullback Leibler divergence; Recognition methods; Reference signals; Spontaneous speech; Voice control; Voice control systems; Speech recognition",,"Elsevier",,,,,01678655,,,"English","Pattern Recogn.

The corresponding transaction costs can be rewritten as a nonlinear function G of the volume of traded assets, with G′(0)>0. For a stock with Black–Scholes midprice dynamics, we exhibit an asymptotically convergent replicating portfolio, defined on a regular time grid with n trading dates. Up to a well-chosen regularization hn of the payoff function, we first introduce the frictionless replicating portfolio of $h^{n}(S^{n}_{1})$, where Sn is a fictitious stock with enlarged local volatility dynamics. In the market with frictions, a suitable modification of this portfolio strategy provides a terminal wealth that converges in $\mathbb{L}^{2}$ to the claim h(S<inf>1</inf>) as n goes to infinity. In terms of order book shapes, the exhibited replicating strategy only depends on the size 2G′(0) of the bid–ask spread. The main innovation of the paper is the introduction of a “Leland-type” strategy for nonvanishing (nonlinear) transaction costs on the volume of traded shares, instead of the commonly considered traded amount of money.

Second, the paper also contributes to the literature on modern corruption by explicitly focusing on the role of the historical legacy in these different aspects of corruption.

The recent experience of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives (ASI) in Russia provides a valuable example of establishing a new government agency to advance economic deregulation in an environment where the political appetite for reform is limited. In our view, ASI has been the most successful institutional innovation to emerge in Russia since the 2008–09 financial crisis. Rather than engage in the traditional tussle over budget funds and benefits, ASI's mandate has been to organise a strategic dialogue with the private sector and build consensus within the government. We consider ASI's institutional set-up in light of the good practice principles adopted under Russia's ‘new industrial policy’.

While the crisis in Ukraine has triggered a fundamental shift in Russia's development path that is likely to make ASI's deregulation efforts largely irrelevant, the agency's practical experience remains pertinent to the broader discussion of institutional arrangements to promote deregulation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",,"deregulation; economic reform; institutional framework; post-communism; reform process; regulatory framework; strategic approach; Russian Federation",,"Routledge",,,,,14631377,,PCECF,"English","Post-Communist Econ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939452376

As beneficiaries of the Soviet paternalistic system of social provision, their interest has been to resist neoliberal policy shifts. However, the crackdown on non-governmental organisations (NGOs) under President Putin de-incentivises making challenging political claims. By distinguishing between ‘rent-seeking’ and ‘profit-seeking’ activities of NGOs (resulting in either the redistribution or production of public wealth), this paper enhances understanding of state–society relations in Russia.

The differences between the zero copulas and lexical verbs turn out to be of two types: a copula allows some uses, prohibited for lexical verbs, and, in contrast, is impossible in other constructions where lexical verbs can participate. The differences are due to two properties of copulas: (1) lack of morphologically-marked categories and (2) lack of a lexical stem. Different types of copulas as distinguished by Testelets (2008) behave differently in syntactic tests, but the picture cannot be reduced to Testelets' two classes of copulas (binominative and non-binominative ones).","Absolute tense interpretation; Adjunct clauses; Relative tense interpretation; Russian; Zero copula",,,"Societa Editrice il Mulino",,,,,17209331,,,"English","Lingue Linguaggio",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954535699

In contrast to equations of a well-known beam-wave interaction theory, it includes the local coupling impedance that characterizes the interaction of electrons with the total field of two waves (forward and counter propagating) of the SWS and does not tend to infinity at cutoff frequencies. It allowed to develop a general theory of interaction of electron beams and waves in passbands and stopbands of SWSs without using their equivalent circuits. A study of beam-wave interaction in the folded waveguide-type SWSs has been performed. An elementary analytical calculation of electrodynamic characteristics of such SWSs necessary to study the interaction is given. Specifies of interaction in passbands and near the cutoff frequencies of periodic SWSs are considered. Amplification conditions in stopbands of such SWSs are discovered.

We use a sample of classrooms in three Russian regions to identify sources of mathematics and Russian teachers' inaccuracies in predicting their high school classes' scores on Russian and mathematics high stakes college entrance tests (the Unified State Exam, or USE). We test the hypothesis that teachers' perceptions of their relationship with their classes are good predictors of such inaccuracies. This is important because teachers often focus on their relationship with the class as an end in itself or as a means to engaging students. Good teacher-student relations may indeed result in more students' learning, but perhaps not nearly as much as teachers' believe. We find that both Russian and mathematics teachers make inaccurate predictions of their class' high stakes examination results based on how they perceive their relationship with their class. Teachers who believe they have a very good relationship with the class significantly overestimate their class' performance on the USE, and those who perceive a poor relationship, underestimate their class' performance, although this underestimate is generally not statistically significant. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Educational policy; High stakes exams; International education; Teacher expectations","academic performance; education policy; mathematics; student; teaching; learning; perception; performance assessment; prediction; secondary education; Russian Federation",,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,07380593,,,"English","Int.

From analysis of a big variety of different knots we conclude that at q, which is a 2m-th root of unity, q2m=1, HOMFLY polynomials in symmetric representations [r] satisfy recursion identity: H<inf>r+m</inf>=H<inf>r</inf>{dot operator}H<inf>m</inf> for any A=qN, which is a generalization of the property Hr=H1r for special polynomials at m=1.

Next, Kashaev polynomial, which arises from H<inf>R</inf> at q2=e2πi/|R|, turns equal to the special polynomial with A substituted by A|R|, provided R is a single-hook representations (including arbitrary symmetric) - what provides a q-A dual to the similar property of Alexander polynomial.

This legitimizing power is highly relevant in social conflicts of modern societies that are governed by market-oriented value systems. However, prejudice research has yet to be linked to sociological discourses on the marketization of society. We argue that Institutional Anomie Theory (IAT), a theory originally developed to explain crime rates, offers a fruitful macro-sociological framework for a better understanding of micro-social prejudices that emerge along with processes of marketization. Extending IAT to explain prejudices in a German study based on survey data offers a first attempt to underpin our theoretical hypotheses with empirical data. Although the results need to be interpreted with due caution, they suggest that the extended IAT model can be usefully applied to explain how a marketized mentality is related to different forms of institutional integration, and how it is conducive to specific prejudices that emerge in market-dominated societies against purported economically burdening social groups. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Institutional anomie; Marketization; Prejudice; Social institutions","adolescent; adult; aged; anomie; attitude; crime; female; Germany; homeless person; human; male; middle aged; migrant; prejudice; questionnaire; social discrimination; social psychology; socioeconomics; thinking; unemployment; very elderly; vulnerable population; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anomie; Attitude; Crime; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Germany; Homeless Persons; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prejudice; Social Discrimination; Social Values; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Thinking; Unemployment; Vulnerable Populations; Young Adult",,"Academic Press Inc.",,,,,0049089X,,SSREB,"English","Soc.

We differentiate pressure-sensitive directors (i.e., with business links) and pressure-resistant directors (i.e., without business links). Our results show that pressure-resistant directors decrease total board compensation and its fixed proportion, whereas they increase the variable proportion of total remuneration and the pay-for-performance sensitivity. By contrast, pressure-sensitive directors offer the opposite results. These findings are consistent with the view that institutional investors are not a homogeneous group and that pressure-resistant directors fulfill a more thorough monitoring role. © 2013 ACEDE.","Board of directors; Compensation; Corporate governance; Institutional investors; Remuneration",,,"Elsevier B.V.",,,,,23409436,,,"English","BRQ Bus.

Applying the modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation, we formulate a generalized Gouy-Chapman theory for the case when an electrolyte solution is mixed with a polar co-solvent having a large polarizability. We show that an increase of the co-solvent concentration as well as the co-solvent polarizability lead to a significant increase of differential capacitance at sufficiently high surface potentials of the electrode, whereas the profile of the electrostatic potential becomes considerably more long-ranged. On the contrary, an increase in the permanent dipole of the co-solvent only weakly affects the differential capacitance. © CopyrightEPLA, 2015.",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing",,,,,02955075,,,"English","EPL",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940189971

Two subsets of trains are given, where trains from the first subset go from the first station to the second station, and trains from the second subset go in the opposite direction. The speed of trains over each segment is the same. A polynomial time reduction from the problem under consideration to a special case of the single-machine equal-processing-time scheduling problem with setup times is presented. Different polynomial time algorithms are developed for special cases with divers objective functions under various constraints. Moreover, several theoretical results which can be ranked in a series of similar investigations of NP-hardness of equal-processing-time single-machine scheduling problems without precedence relations are obtained.","Computational complexity; Polynomial time algorithms; Setup times; Single machine scheduling; Train scheduling; Transportation","Algorithms; Computational complexity; Machinery; Polynomial approximation; Polynomials; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Scheduling algorithms; Transportation; Polynomial-time algorithms; Polynomial-time reduction; Precedence relations; Set-up time; Single machine scheduling problems; Single track railway; Single-machine scheduling; Train scheduling; Scheduling",,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,03608352,,CINDD,"English","Comput Ind Eng",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928480302

Current estimates of cancer burden in individual countries and regions are necessary to inform local cancer control strategies. OBJECTIVE: To estimate mortality, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 28 cancers in 188 countries by sex from 1990 to 2013. EVIDENCE REVIEW: The general methodology of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study was used. Cancer registries were the source for cancer incidence data as well as mortality incidence (MI) ratios. Sources for cause of death data include vital registration system data, verbal autopsy studies, and other sources. The MI ratios were used to transform incidence data to mortality estimates and cause of death estimates to incidence estimates. Cancer prevalence was estimated using MI ratios as surrogates for survival data; YLDs were calculated by multiplying prevalence estimates with disability weights, which were derived from population-based surveys; YLLs were computed by multiplying the number of estimated cancer deaths at each age with a reference life expectancy; and DALYs were calculated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. FINDINGS: In 2013 there were 14.9 million incident cancer cases, 8.2 million deaths, and 196.3 million DALYs. Prostate cancer was the leading cause for cancer incidence (1.4 million) for men and breast cancer for women (1.8 million). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer was the leading cause for cancer death in men and women, with 1.6 million deaths. For men, TBL cancer was the leading cause of DALYs (24.9 million). For women, breast cancer was the leading cause of DALYs (13.1 million). Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) per 100 000 and age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) per 100 000 for both sexes in 2013 were higher in developing vs developed countries for stomach cancer (ASIR, 17 vs 14; ASDR, 15 vs 11), liver cancer (ASIR, 15 vs 7; ASDR, 16 vs 7), esophageal cancer (ASIR, 9 vs 4; ASDR, 9 vs 4), cervical cancer (ASIR, 8 vs 5; ASDR, 4 vs 2), lip and oral cavity cancer (ASIR, 7 vs 6; ASDR, 2 vs 2), and nasopharyngeal cancer (ASIR, 1.5 vs 0.4; ASDR, 1.2 vs 0.3). Between 1990 and 2013, ASIRs for all cancers combined (except nonmelanoma skin cancer and Kaposi sarcoma) increased by more than 10% in 113 countries and decreased by more than 10% in 12 of 188 countries. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cancer poses a major threat to public health worldwide, and incidence rates have increased in most countries since 1990. The trend is a particular threat to developing nations with health systems that are ill-equipped to deal with complex and expensive cancer treatments. The annual update on the Global Burden of Cancer will provide all stakeholders with timely estimates to guide policy efforts in cancer prevention, screening, treatment, and palliation.

This study analyzed Der Spiegel’s articles presenting the crisis and austerity in Europe, focusing on the Greek case, from 2009 until 2014. A thematic analysis was developed in the study a broad corpus of articles, focusing on the main ideas they unfold. Deploying critical political economy literature, critical cultural theory and critical media studies literature, the article criticizes the neoliberal hegemony of the EU’s crisis politics and foregrounds the role of mainstream media, including progressivist or objectivist ones such as Spiegel, in the reproduction of neoliberal ideas that expand far beyond the crisis, to produce the institutions, social relations, beliefs and subjectivities for a post-crisis configuration of capitalism. The article concludes that Spiegel, like other mainstream media, produce a biopolitical policing of the crisis’ exceptionalized subjects (the citizens of indebted countries) and the implementation of crisis-politics by creating a public “structure of feeling” related to the hegemonic crisis’ rationales. These rationales are further connected to the development of the new neoliberal subjectivity, which is an objective of the crisis-reforms, such as austerity regimes. In effect, main- stream media discourses reproduce the hegemonic frames of the crisis and austerity, while negating the possibility of new narratives to emerge in the crisis context. © 2015 Unified Theory of Information Research Group.

After the crisis of late 1990s, the government declared science and technology (S&T) as one of national priorities and started increasingly investing in this sector but it has not led to the tangible output like a bigger volume of high-tech exports or a higher share of international publications. A number of policy instruments have been introduced to increase the efficiency of STI policies. One of them is S&T Foresight. The activities aimed at identification of national S&T priorities and series of Foresight studies have helped to understand which areas are most promising for sustaining existing competitive advantages and building new ones via gradual shift from the resource-based economy towards the technology-oriented one.

The problem is treated as rigorously as possible using boundary conditions appropriate to conventional time of flight experiments. Two types of pulsed carrier generation are considered. In addition to the traditional case of surface excitation, we also consider the case where carrier generation is spatially uniform. In our analysis, the front electrode is treated as a reflecting boundary, while the counter electrode is assumed to act either as a neutral contact (not disturbing the current flow) or as an absorbing boundary at which the carrier concentration vanishes. As expected, at low fields transient currents exhibit unusual behavior, as diffusion currents overwhelm drift currents to such an extent that it becomes impossible to determine transit times (and hence, carrier mobilities). At high fields, computed transients are more like those typically observed, with well-defined plateaus and sharp transit times. Careful analysis, however, reveals that the non-dispersive picture, and predictions of the CDE contradict both experiment and existing disorder-based theories in important ways, and that the CDE should be applied rather cautiously, and even then only for engineering purposes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The conditions of the correspondence impose restrictions on this function. In particular, it satisfies the heat equation.

One of the channels for this process is the dynamical Lamb effect, induced by a nonadiabatic modulation of the atomic-level Lamb shift. However, in experiments with natural atoms it is quite difficult to isolate this effect from other mechanisms of atom excitation. We point out that a transmission line cavity coupled with a superconducting qubit (an artificial macroscopic atom) provides a unique platform for observation of the dynamical Lamb effect. A key idea is to exploit a dynamically tunable qubit-resonator coupling, which was implemented quite recently. By varying the coupling nonadiabatically, it is possible to parametrically excite a qubit through a nonadiabatic modulation of the Lamb shift, even if the cavity was initially empty. The dynamics of such a coupled system is studied within the Rabi model with a time-dependent coupling constant and beyond the rotating-wave approximation. An efficient method to increase the effect through the periodic and nonadiabatic switching of the qubit-resonator coupling energy is proposed. © 2015 American Physical Society. ©2015 American Physical Society.",,"Atoms; Modulation; Quantum optics; Resonators; Atom excitation; Beyond the rotating wave approximations; Coupled systems; Coupling constants; Resonator coupling; Superconducting qubits; Time dependent; Time dependent parameter; Quantum computers",,"American Physical Society",,,,,10502947,,PLRAA,"English","Phys Rev A",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937441032

Among the objects of FX m, in addition to the Tate motives Z/m(j), there are the cohomological relative motives with compact support Mcc m (Y/X) of varieties Y quasi-finite over X. Exact functors of inverse image with respect to morphisms of algebraic varieties and direct image with compact supports with respect to quasifinite morphisms of varieties Y → X act on the exact categories FX m. Assuming the existence of triangulated categories of motivic sheaves DM(X, Z/m) over algebraic varieties X over K and a weak version of the 'six operations' in these categories, we identify Fm X with the exact subcategory in DM(X, Z/m) consisting of all the iterated extensions of the Tate twists Mcc m (Y/X)(j) of the motives Mcc m (Y/X). An isomorphism of the Z/m-modules Ext between the Tate motives Z/m(j) in the exact category FX m with the motivic cohomology modules predicted by the Beilinson- Lichtenbaum étale descent conjecture (recently proved by Voevodsky, Rost et al.) holds for smooth varieties X over K if and only if the similar isomorphism holds for Artin-Tate motives over fields containing K. When K contains a primitive m-root of unity, the latter condition is equivalent to a certain Koszulity hypothesis, as shown in our previous paper [Positselski, 'Mixed Artin-Tate motives with finite coefficients', Mosc.

Our first result is the Cohen-Macaulayness property (as modules over the polynomial ring) of Cherednik algebra modules with minimal support. Our second result is an explicit formula for the character of an irreducible minimal support module in type An-1 for c=mn, and an expression of its quasispherical part (i.e., the isotypic part of ""hooks"") in terms of the HOMFLY polynomial of a torus knot colored by a Young diagram. We use this formula and the work of Calaque, Enriquez and Etingof to give explicit formulas for the characters of the irreducible equivariant D-modules on the nilpotent cone for SLm. Our third result is the construction of the Koszul-BGG complex for the rational Cherednik algebra, which generalizes the construction of the Koszul-BGG resolution from [3] and [21], and the calculation of its homology in type A. We also show in type A that the differentials in the Koszul-BGG complex are uniquely determined by the condition that they are nonzero homomorphisms of modules over the Cherednik algebra.

In fact, we show that the simple quotients of the corresponding quasispherical subalgebras are isomorphic as filtered algebras.

There are many reasons why students choose to work, from the need to integrate into the job market to the desire to fill spare time. The present article investigates how various study and work combinations affect the academic performance of students in their final years in Tatarstan higher education institutions. The article examines the first set of results produced by longitudinal studies commenced in 2009 by the Institute of Education, NRU HSE (National Research University, Higher School of Economics). Two factors - work schedule and correspondence between the type of work and the future profession - are used to identify five types of study and work combinations. Various combinations reveal different levels of academic performance, different plans for the future, and somewhat different reasons for having entered an institution of higher education. Regression analysis of the data showed that only one type of study and work combination - non-professional fulltime employment - has a negative effect on academic performance. Other strategies of student employment showed no statistically significant effect on academic performance. All other conditions being equal, professionally employed students perform better than their non-professionally employed counterparts, and sometimes even better than those who do not work at all. The article concludes that the optimal strategy for students is to combine study with professional part-time employment. In this case, work becomes an additional source of knowledge and skills, as well as a motivation to learn. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,"Routledge",,,,,10609393,,,"English","Russ. Educ.

The idea behind the proposed assessment model is that with the necessary data consistent correlations between student performance and contextual factors can be empirically identified. Researchers usually establish these correlations using a multiple regression analysis. The results of the analysis, established empirical correlations, may be used to contextualize formal progress (i.e., to adjust expectations for institutions working in more or less favorable conditions). Two possible applications of this information are discussed: one based on a formula and the other on an index specially developed by the authors for measuring school's social prosperity. Finally, possible constraints associated with these models and the contextual factors for assessing the quality of education in Russia are analyzed. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,"Routledge",,,,,10609393,,,"English","Russ.

We say that Z is trianalytic if it is complex analytic with respect to J and K, and absolutely trianalytic if it is trianalytic with respect to any hyperkähler triple of complex structures (M, I, J', K') containing I. For a generic complex structure I on M, all complex subvarieties of (M, I) are absolutely trianalytic. It is known that the normalization Z' of a trianalytic subvariety is smooth; we prove that b2(Z')≥b2(M), when M has maximal holonomy (that is, M is IHS).To study absolutely trianalytic subvarieties further, we define a new geometric structure, called k-symplectic structure; this structure is a generalization of hypersymplectic structure. A k-symplectic structure on a 2. d-dimensional manifold X is a k-dimensional space R of closed 2-forms on X which all have rank 2. d or d. It is called non-degenerate if the set of all degenerate forms in R is a smooth, non-degenerate quadric hypersurface in R.

Regions and cities of these countries were the focus of the research (territorial units level NUTS-3). The analysis addresses the question to what degree the remoteness from the regional centre, i.e. the position in the core-periphery system, influences the dynamics of the population size of the territorial units of the given level. For the analytical purposes the distinction has been made between the regional centres including adjacent suburban areas and internal regional periphery comprising districts and cities. The main indicator employed was the distance between the periphery areas and regional centres. The results of the analysis show that in spite of the depopulation of all three countries and severe transformational crisis, there was a steady growth of the population size in the regional centres, while the periphery areas of the regions continued to lose the population. The mentioned differences are primarily determined by migration flows, since the fertility rates are below the replacement level in all the countries' territories. Population tends to concentrate in the regional centres, which means urbanisation has not been completed yet. While similar patterns of population decline are observed in the periphery areas of Ukraine and Belarus, in Russia the depopulation rates are negatively influenced by the factor of remoteness of a periphery area from the regional centre. All three countries experienced rural population decline everywhere but suburban areas of the regional centres. © Bulletin of Geography.

Contacts established in the 1920s ceased between 1947 and 1953, the Cold War’s tensest moments. To reestablish them, N. S. Khrushchev dispatched delegations of experts to the United States, the first in the summer of 1955. Visiting farms, factories, laboratories, and land-grant colleges, Soviet officials everywhere found a system of industrial farming comprised of high-yielding crop varieties, labor-saving machines, and modern management practices. Drawing on documents from archives in Moscow, I argue that Khrushchev looked to this industrial ideal to inspire his agricultural programs. Considered as a part of global trends, Khrushchev’s initiatives appear rational rather than “harebrained,” as critics have judged them.

This article investigates CD as receivinggifts for sex, such as luxuries, rent, travel, or monetary gifts. It proceeds by describing who engages in the practice and why, while comparing Russia with its cultural and linguistic neighbors, Ukraine and Belarus. A survey, which was answered by a representative sample (n = 678) from the cities of Moscow, Kyiv, and Minsk, indicates that CD reception rates are comparable to elsewhere in the world. Moreover, while these cities have similar CD rates, there are important inter-city differences in the characteristics that make people more or less likely to take part. CD reception is linked to status in Kyiv and Moscow but is more closely tied to economic survival in Minsk. Moreover, while Kyiv and Moscow CD reception is affected by the importance of instrumental economic logic within relationships, there is no indication that other relationship values, such as love, have suffered as a result.

In particular we observe that it plays more and more important role in the support of the world economic growth (as well as high prices of certain very important commodities). In the meantime the perspectives of the Chinese economy (as well as possible fates of the Chinese society) remain unclear, whereas respective forecasts look rather contradictory. That is why the search for new aspects and modes of analysis of possible development of China turns out to be rather important for the forecasting of global futures. This article employs a combination of scientific methods that imply (a) the analysis at the level of Chinese economic model; (b) the analysis at regional level (at this level the Chinese economic model is compared with the regional East Asian model); (c) the analysis at the global level that relies on the modified world-system approach that allows to answer the question whether China will replace the USA as the global leader. It is important that the analysis is conducted simultaneously in economic, social, demographic, and political dimensions. As regards the analysis of specific features of the Chinese model as an especial type of the East Asian model (that is based on the export orientation, capital & technology importation, as well as cheap labor force), we note as organic features of the Chinese model the totalitarian power of the Communist Party and the immenseness of resources. As regards special features of the Chinese model, we note (in addition to ""cheap ecology"" and cheap labor force) and emphasize that China has a multilevel (in a way unique) system of growth driving forces, where, as opposed to developed states, the dominant role belongs not to native private capital, but to state corporations, local authorities and foreign business. This explains the peculiarities of the Chinese investment (or rather overinvestment), which determines high growth rate up to a very significant degree. A unique feature of the Chinese model is the competition of provinces and territories for investments and high growth indicators. As regards perspectives of the global hegemony of China, we intend to demonstrate that, on the one hand, economic and political positions of China will strengthen in the forthcoming decades, but, on the other hand, China, assuming all possible future success, will be unable to take the USA position in the World System. We believe that in a direct connection with the development of globalization processes the hegemony cycle pattern is likely to come to its end, which will lead to the World System reconfiguration and the emergence of its new structure that will allow the World System to continue its further development without a hegemon. Finally, the article describes some possible scenarios of the development of China. We demonstrate that China could hardly avoid serious difficulties and critical situations (including those connected with demographic problems); however, there could be different scenarios of how China will deal with the forthcoming crisis. We also come to the conclusion that it would be better for China to achieve a slowdown to moderate growth rates (that would allow China to go through the forthcoming complex transition period with less losses) than to try to return at any cost to explosive growth rates attested in the 2000s. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","China; Demography; Economy; Forecast; Social change; Technological development",,,"Elsevier Inc.",,,,,00401625,,,"English","Technol.

We provide rare evidence of the effects of horizontal educational mismatch on earnings, job satisfaction, and perceived job mobility of self-employed workers. We find that educational mismatch has differential influence on women's and men's experiences. Although both men and women have an earnings penalty for being mismatched, only mismatched women suffer from reduction in job satisfaction. Women who work outside their field of study while caring for their small children are in the most vulnerable position. They experience negative socio-economic outcomes in all dimensions: reduction in earnings, job satisfaction, and express intentions to change their current employment situation. We argue that these findings may be evidence of gendered career strategies and greater family demands for women in the new economy. © 2015 International Sociological Association Research Committee 28 on Social Stratification and Mobility.","Educational mismatch; Freelancers; Gender and work; Job satisfaction; Perceived job mobility",,,"JAI Press",,,,,02765624,,,"English","Res.

The injected microwave signal (~1 GHz) serves the dual purpose of pumping the HEB element and enabling the read-out of the internal state of the device. A cryogenic amplifier amplifies the reflected microwave signal from the device and a homodyne scheme recovers the effects of the incident THz radiation. Two modes of operation have been identified, depending on the level of incident radiation. For weak signals, we use a chopper to chop the incident radiation against a black body reference and a lock-in amplifier to perform synchronous detection of the homodyne readout. The voltage measured is proportional to the incident power, and we estimate an optical noise equivalent power of ~5pW/√Hz at 0.83 THz. At higher signal levels, the homodyne circuit recovers the stream of steady relaxation oscillation pulses from the HEB device. The frequency of these pulses is in the MHz frequency range and bears a linear relationship with the incident THz radiation over an input power range of ~15 dB.

We use a probe frequency of 1.5 GHz. The microwave probe picks up impedance changes of the HEB, which are examined upon demodulation of the reflected wave outside the cryostat. This study shows that the HEB mixer operates in two different regimes under a terahertz pump. At a low pumping level, strong pulse modulation is observed, as the device switches between the superconducting state and the normal state at a rate of a few megahertz. When pumped much harder, to approximate the low-noise mixer operating point, residual modulation can still be observed, showing that the HEB mixer is intrinsically unstable even in the resistive state. Based on these observations, we introduced a low-frequency termination to the HEB mixer. By terminating the device in a 50- Ω resistor in the megahertz frequency range, we have been able to improve the output-power Allan time of our HEB receiver by a factor of four to about 10 s for a detection bandwidth of 15 MHz, with a corresponding gain fluctuation of about 0.035%. © 2014 IEEE.","Allan variance; hot-electron-bolometer mixer; relaxation oscillation; stability","Convergence of numerical methods; Hot electrons; Infrared detectors; Modulation; Optical pumping; Probes; Allan variance; Gain fluctuations; Megahertz frequencies; Microwave injection; Operating points; Power fluctuations; Relaxation oscillation; Superconducting state; Bolometers",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,10518223,,ITASE,"English","IEEE Trans Appl Supercond",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919819696

However, the existing attempts at explaining these phenomena and their background share two significant drawbacks: first, no model (to the best of our knowledge) has managed to account for both the Great Divergence and the Great Convergence so as to explain the timing of the trend change (around 1970s). Second, most existing models concentrate heavily on the economic forces, frequently neglecting the demographic factor. We offer an approach to overcome these drawbacks, revealing a close coupling between phases of global demographic transition and phases of the Great Divergence and Great Convergence. As we account for the crucial role of the demographic component in these processes, we show that the timing of the trend change was not coincidental. Our findings suggest that the dynamics of global population growth and the Great Divergence and Great Convergence therefore may be considered so closely coupled as to be two sides of the same coin. On the other hand, they also suggest that the Great Divergence and Great Convergence should be treated as a single process, as two phases of the global modernization. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Convergence; Demographic transition; Divergence; Globalization; Modernization","Modernization; Population dynamics; Close coupling; Convergence; Demographic factors; Demographic transition; Divergence; Economic forces; Global population; Globalization; Population statistics",,"Elsevier Inc.",,,,,00401625,,,"English","Technol.

To explore the near-IR spectral range, we propose a fiber-coupled NbN film based HEB mixer. To enhance the incident-light absorption, a quasi-antenna consisting of a set of parallel stripes of gold is used. To study the antenna effect on the mixer performance, we have experimentally studied a set of devices with different size of the Au stripe and spacing between the neighboring stripes. With use of the well-known isotherm technique we have estimated the absorption efficiency of the mixer, and the maximum efficiency has been observed for devices with the smallest pitch of the alternating NbN and NbN-Au stripes. Also, a proper alignment of the incident E-field with respect to the stripes allows us to improve the coupling further. Studying IV-characteristics of the mixer under differently-aligned E-field of the incident radiation, we have noticed a difference in their shape.

The effect has been observed in models of individual neurons, and in experiments performed on real neural systems. Despite the ubiquity of biophysical sources of stochastic noise in the nervous system, however, it has not yet been established whether neuronal computation mechanisms involved in performance of specific functions such as perception or learning might exploit such noise as an integral component, such that removal of the noise would diminish performance of these functions. In this paper we revisit the methods used to demonstrate stochastic resonance in models of single neurons. This includes a previously unreported observation in a multicompartmental model of a CA1-pyramidal cell. We also discuss, as a contrast to these classical studies, a form of 'stochastic facilitation', known as inverse stochastic resonance. We draw on the reviewed examples to argue why new approaches to studying 'stochastic facilitation' in neural systems need to be developed. © 2015 Informa UK Ltd.

The NIS is presented as three interrelated macro blocs: business environment, environment producing new knowledge, and knowledge transfer mechanism. The principles of performance and efficiency measuring of NIS are proposed. The system structure-object and functional approaches to NIS performance and efficiency are applied. The former is used for decomposition of NIS objects of high aggregation level. The latter is available for analysis of NIS efficiency and its factors. The methods allow the estimation of the NIS component by component and identification of the cause-effect chains of factor impacts on its elements.

Cortical oscillations have been proposed as instruments of sensory de-multiplexing, i.e., theparallel processing of different frequency streams in sensorysignals. Yet their causal role in such a process has never been demonstrated. Here we used a neural microcircuit model to address whether coupled theta-gamma oscillations, as observed in human auditory cortex, could underpin the multiscale sensory analysis of speech. We show that, in continuous speech, theta oscillations can flexibly track the syllabic rhythm and temporally organize the phoneme-level response of gamma neurons into a code that enables syllable identification. The tracking of slow speech fluctuations by theta oscillations, and its coupling to gamma-spiking activity both appeared as critical features for accurate speech encoding. These results demonstrate that cortical oscillations can be a key instrument of speech de-multiplexing, parsing, and encoding. © 2015 eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

These triggering structures can be further used for knowledge discovery and classification purposes. Computation of the structural alerts results from an implementation of a sophisticated workflow that integrates a graph mining tool guided by growth rate and stability. The growth rate is a well-established measurement of contrast between classes. Moreover, the extracted patterns correspond to formal concepts; the most robust patterns, named the stable emerging patterns (SEPs), can then be identified thanks to their stability, a new notion originating from the domain of formal concept analysis. All of these elements are explained in the paper from the point of view of computation. The method was applied to a molecular data set on mutagenicity. The experimental results demonstrate its efficiency: it automatically outputs a manageable number of structural patterns that are strongly related to mutagenicity. Moreover, a part of the resulting structures corresponds to already known structural alerts. Finally, an in-depth chemical analysis relying on these structures demonstrates how the method can initiate promising processes of chemical knowledge discovery. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemical analysis; Data mining; Emerging patterns; Formal concepts; Graph mining; Its efficiencies; Molecular data; Molecular patterns; Robust patterns; Structural pattern; Formal concept analysis; mutagenic agent; automated pattern recognition; chemistry; data mining; drug development; procedures; Data Mining; Drug Discovery; Mutagens; Pattern Recognition, Automated",,"American Chemical Society",,,,,15499596,,JCISD,"English","J.

The authors focus on two Scandinavian countries, Denmark and Sweden, which have seen a rise in extreme-right activities across different arenas and in different media in the turbulent years since the collapse of global financial markets in 2008. Drawing on a discourse-theoretical framework that builds on the work of Laclau and Mouffe, the paper examines how the currently most active and visible extreme-right groups in these two countries understand and respond to the crisis as an opportunity to fuel anti-immigration discourses and prey on sentiments of instability and insecurity in the broader population, using online media to “involve members and supporters in the discursive construction of racism”. The analysis demonstrates how these groups look to Greece, as the “crisis epicentre”, for culturalist explanations for the Eurozone crisis and to the rise there of Golden Dawn as an inspiration for future mobilisations in Nordic and pan-European coalitions. © 2015 EURICOM.","Anti-public spheres; Cultural racism; Denmark; European economic crisis; Extreme-right activism; Online media; Sweden",,,"EURICOM",,,,,13183222,,,"English","Javnost",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949678349

It was found that college entrants still use traditional forms of preparation despite the new institutional admission conditions at universities. However, it was expected that after the unification of the examination system prospective students would be less likely to resort to extra classes in order to prepare for university entrance. A survey of first-year students and their parents was conducted. It included a total of 1,600 households in the 16 largest Russian cities. A positive relationship was found between monetary investments and time spent on additional preparation courses, on the one hand, and exam results, on the other. However, the return on these investments was low. These results were based on an assessment of a modified function of the educational achievements of students. On the one hand, this means that the results of the USE are connected to the efforts of prospective students, and on the other it shows that those who pursue additional preparation outside of school may gain an advantage by achieving an overall higher score, thereby creating inequality in access to higher education. The particular school that a student is enrolled in and that student's school performance are more significant factors in some cases than the effect of additional preparation. © 2015 © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,"Routledge",,,,,10609393,,,"English","Russ.

She investigates how they structure their work schedule and academic productivity, and how universities with and without special status differ. The study is based on data from two international studies conducted in Russia and other countries: International Academic Profession (1991-93) and Changing Academic Profession (2007-12). In Russia, most university instructors prefer teaching to research, in contrast to the preferences of academics in many other countries. The distribution of the preferences of instructors at institutions with ""research university"" status is no different from that of instructors at institutions without special status. Although the research workload of instructors who prefer to conduct research is greater and the tasks they perform are less routine, they experience less stress and have greater job satisfaction. The author concludes that the distribution of instructors' preferences reflects the peculiarities of the higher education system in the USSR and the Russian Federation, including the focus of its universities on teaching, the allocation of research functions to institutions that are separate from universities, and the poor funding of universities in general and their research functions in particular. © 2015 © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,"Routledge",,,,,10609393,,,"English","Russ.

The era of traditional television as a typical broadcasting technology, a traditional social, economic and cultural phenomenon, has come to an end. We are on the verge of a global and irrevocable shift to mass utilization of various digital devices that certainly affect the positions of television as a separate industry. Modern television is outlined as a part of a wide digital media market, just a segment of a highly competitive entertainment structure with complex network interactions. In terms of Russia, the new phenomena accompanying the evolution of media and television markets in the process of digitalization urgently need an economic analysis. In what direction is it necessary to develop the local broadcasting? Is there a sound commercial future of national and regional television companies? What lessons can extract Russia from world experience? What else does Russian television need to improve efficiency and global competitiveness? These issues are detail considered in the article.

The impact of a merger on market competition depends on before-merger market structure and competition. Goal of this study is to test the ability of financial markets to take into account initial competition conditions and the applicability of event study method for the assessment of merger effects for different product markets (export vs. domestic, more or less competitive), and for different types of mergers (horizontal vs. vertical). We examine deals among large companies, supplying in two markets with a substantially different degree of competition, and analyze the impact of a merger on industrial customers as well as merging companies and their competitors by the example of Russian ferrous and non-ferrous metal industries from 1999 to 2011. Two findings distinguish this paper from others in the contemporary literature: the application of event study methodology for the assessment of competitive effects of mergers involving Russian companies and the comparison of competitive and efficiency effects of vertical and horizontal mergers between participants of the same product market. The main result is that event studies are sensitive to the structure and the organization of product market affected. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Competition; Event studies; Mergers and acquisitions; Russia",,,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,02755319,,,"English","Res.

But the most recent large scale study in this area (Hell & Päβler, 2011) was based on online surveys of occupational interest rather than actual choices. Our paper is based on a large scale survey of working age Russians from the Moscow region who also consented to have measurements of their fingers taken. Using the Holland classification of job types, we observed that women in enterprising occupations exhibited lower measured 2D:4D ratios (higher prenatal testosterone exposure) than average while those in conventional and social work had higher 2D:4D ratios. There were also a number of significant differences in average 2D:4D ratios between people in different occupational groups. In general it is consistent with views that low 2D:4D is associated with more male-specific interests and high 2D:4D with more stereotypical female interests. But interpretation of the results depends on the relative accuracy of the Holland typology and may be influenced by the fact that similar groupings may mask different types of jobs for men and women within the same Holland occupational class. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","2D:4D; Gender differences; Holland occupational themes; Occupational choice",,,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,01918869,,PEIDD,"English","Pers.

Although Petri nets are graphical and easy to understand, they have formal semantics and allow for analysis techniques ranging from model checking and structural analysis to process mining and performance analysis. Over time Petri nets emerged as a solid foundation for Business Process Management (BPM) research. The BPM discipline develops methods, techniques, and tools to support the design, enactment, management, and analysis of operational business processes. Mainstream business process modeling notations and workflow management systems are using token-based semantics borrowed from Petri nets. Moreover, state-of-the-art BPM analysis techniques are using Petri nets as an internal representation. Users of BPM methods and tools are often not aware of this.

The Arab spring events of 2011–2012 are not an exception in this context. The next outburst of protest activity occurred where it was not expected in the near future—in Ukraine. If we compare the events in the Arab countries in 2011 and Ukraine in 2013–2014, it can be concluded that in essence they fit the characteristics of fitnah very well, which are attributed to it by the Arabic political culture. In both cases, the fitnah acquired permanent character turning into anarchy and chaos (“fouda”). The government/the ruling power found itself unprepared for such manifestations of fitnah and miscalculated the threat posed by the protesters. From our perspective, in the modern world this phenomenon can be explained by the rapid development of Internet technologies that gives the opposition an opportunity to prepare a protest virtually, in an area not totally controlled by the government. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Arab spring; Fitnah; Internet technologies; Political destabilization; Revolution",,,"MDPI AG",,,,,20771444,,,"English","Religions",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930942208

The referential flexibility of temporal expressions is well understood in linguistics but its neurocognitive bases remain unknown. We aimed at obtaining a neural signature of shifting times in narrative language. We recorded and analyzed event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and oscillatory responses to the adverb 'now' and to the second main verb in Punctual ('An hour ago the boy stole a candy and now he peeled the fruit') and Iterative ('The entire afternoon the boy stole candy and now he peeled the fruit') contexts. 'An hour ago' introduces a time frame that lies entirely in the past, 'now' shifts the narrative to the present, and 'peeled' shifts it back to the past. These two referential shifts in Punctual contexts are expected to leave very similar traces on neural responses. In contrast, 'The entire afternoon' specifies a time frame that may encompass past, present and future, such that both 'now' and 'peeled' are consistent with it. Here, no time shift is required. We found no difference in ERPs between Punctual and Iterative contexts either at ' now' or at the second verb. However, reference shifts modulated oscillatory signals. 'Now' and the second verb in Punctual contexts resulted in similar responses: an increase in gamma power with a left-anterior distribution. Gamma bursts were absent in Iterative contexts. We propose that gamma oscillations here reflect the binding of temporal variables to the values allowed by constraints introduced by temporal expressions in discourse. © 2015 Brederoo et al.",,"adult; Article; controlled study; event related potential; female; gamma rhythm; grammar; human; human experiment; language; language processing; linguistics; male; narrative; nerve potential; normal human; oscillatory potential; prediction; semantics; stimulus response; brain; evoked response; linguistics; physiology; procedures; time; young adult; Adult; Brain; Evoked Potentials; Female; Humans; Language; Linguistics; Male; Time; Young Adult",,"Public Library of Science",,,,,19326203,,POLNC,"English","PLoS ONE",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928807112

We used an instrumental variable, which allowed us to estimate the effect of one year of schooling through the fuzzy method of regression discontinuity. The analysis was performed both for regular and vocational education programs collectively as well as individually for regular schools. It was found that in general for Russian students enrolled in all programs, the effectiveness of one year of schooling is insignificant. In countries that practice the early separation of students into regular and vocational programs, the effectiveness of schooling is lower than in countries where all fifteen-year-olds are enrolled in regular programs. The effectiveness of one year of schooling for students enrolled in regular educational programs is significant in all countries. Students enrolled in vocational programs typically perform more poorly than those enrolled in regular programs. The strength of the relationship between the socioeconomic status of the student's family and the effectiveness of schooling are highly dependent on the education system and vary from country to country. For Russia, as well as for some other countries, the effectiveness of schooling does not depend on socioeconomic status. The significance of these results for the evaluation of the effectiveness of schooling, and in particular for the fair evaluation of national achievement in countries that offer different educational trajectories, is discussed. © 2015 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,"Routledge",,,,,10609393,,,"English","Russ.

The article justifies why it focuses on specific labor market segments and the nature of the university's basic product as grounds for proposing a typology and groups of institutions. A Soviet ""master plan"" is reconstructed on the basis of the formulated approach to the typology. It is important because, according to the authors, the current structure of the Russian system of higher education is largely determined by how it developed during the Soviet period. It is shown that the Soviet project was built on the idea of administrative regulation of the labor market, and it is argued that it generally implemented a quasi-corporate system model of higher vocational education. The article analyzes how the structure of the higher education system that Russia inherited from the Soviet Union changed under the influence of factors that were mainly external to the education system. It was changed to a much lesser degree by deliberate government policy. The typology of higher education institutions that results from these changes is described based on an analysis of quantitative data. The authors consider possible structural policy directions in the field of higher vocational education as a foundation for working out a ""master plan"" for restructuring the higher education system in Russia.

As a result, the pulp industry became a space for considerable innovation. In Sweden, Johan Richter developed the Kamyr digester, a pulp cooker that could run continuously and was adopted by industry within a decade. Prior to Richter, Soviet engineer Leonid Zherebov designed a similar cooker. But after 25 years of experiments, Zherebov’s design failed, and Soviet factories began to produce pulp using imported Kamyr digesters. This article examines the history of continuous pulp cooking in the Soviet Union as a means to understand the nature of Russian technological innovation and its failures. The paper contends that his effort failed because of the technological system developed by Soviet forestry – a system characterized by a lack of open communication among its main institutional actors and a scarcity of resources to facilitate innovation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","continuous cooking; Kamyr; pulp and paper industry; Soviet Union; Technological innovation; Zherebov",,,"Routledge",,,,,07341512,,,"English","Hist.

Abundant material collected in many localities from the Barents Sea, via the Arctic region, to the north-west Pacific was analysed for the first time. An integrated approach combining morphological and ontogenetic data with molecular four-gene (COI, 16S, H3, and 28S) analysis reveals seven species, including three previously undescribed. Dendronotus frondosus (Ascanius, 1774) and Dendronotus dalli Bergh, 1879 were commonly considered as amphiboreal species; however, according to this study they are restricted to the North Atlantic and the North Pacific, respectively. In the north-west Pacific two new species were discovered, Dendronotus kamchaticussp.nov. and Dendronotus kalikalsp.nov., that are externally similar to D.frondosus, but that show significant distance according to molecular analysis and are considerably different in radular morphology. In the North Atlantic a new species Dendronotus niveussp.nov., sibling to North Pacific D.dalli, is revealed. The separate status of North Atlantic Dendronotus lacteus (Thompson, 1840) is confirmed, including considerable range extension. The essential similarity of early ontogenetic stages of radular development common for species with disparate adult radular morphology (such as D.frondosus and D.dalli) is shown, and its importance for taxonomy is discussed. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London.","Molecular analysis; Molluscs; Morphology; Ontogeny; Phylogenetics; Taxonomy","Dendronotus; Dendronotus dalli; Dendronotus frondosus; Dendronotus lacteus; Gastropoda; Mollusca; Nudibranchia",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",,,,,00244082,,ZJLSA,"English","Zool.

It differs from the existing versions by the randomization method. Randomization is performed at the stage of the projection of a subgradient of the function being optimized onto the unit simplex rather than at the stage of the computation of a subgradient, which is common practice. As a result, a componentwise subgradient descent with a randomly chosen component is obtained, which admits an online interpretation.

We also demonstrate how to get the set of 'minimal' integrals of motion, using the co-multiplication rules for the corresponding Lie algebras. In the non-simply laced case the corresponding Bogoyavlensky-Coxeter-Toda systems are constructed using the Fock-Goncharov folding of the corresponding Poisson submanifolds.

Most studies focus on how supralinear summation of excitatory synaptic responses arising from clustered inputs within single dendrites result in the enhancement of neuronal firing, enabling simple computations such as feature detection. Recent reports have shown that sublinear summation is also a prominent dendritic operation, extending the range of subthreshold input-output (sI/O) transformations conferred by dendrites. Like supralinear operations, sublinear dendritic operations also increase the repertoire of neuronal computations, but feature extraction requires different synaptic connectivity strategies for each of these operations. In this article we will review the experimental and theoretical findings describing the biophysical determinants of the three primary classes of dendritic operations: linear, sublinear, and supralinear. We then review a Boolean algebra-based analysis of simplified neuron models, which provides insight into how dendritic operations influence neuronal computations. We highlight how neuronal computations are critically dependent on the interplay of dendritic properties (morphology and voltage-gated channel expression), spiking threshold and distribution of synaptic inputs carrying particular sensory features. Finally, we describe how global (scattered) and local (clustered) integration strategies permit the implementation of similar classes of computations, one example being the object feature binding problem. © 2015 Tran-Van-Minh, Cazé, Abrahamsson, Cathala, Gutkin and DiGregorio.","Binary neruons; Boolean analysis; Dendrites; Input-output transformation; Neural computation; Nonlinear transformations; Uncaging; Votlage activated channels","action potential; Article; connectome; genetic transformation; human; information science; mathematical parameters; membrane conductance; membrane depolarization; membrane potential; protein expression; sensitivity analysis; sensorimotor integration; signal processing; spike wave",,"Frontiers Research Foundation",,,,,16625102,,,"English","Front.

However, people often act upon self-interest in irrational ways that threaten the long-term survival of the whole group. A lack of sustainable or environmentally responsible behavior is often observed. In this study, we examine how the maximization of benefits principle works in a wider social interactive context of personality preferences in order to gain a more realistic insight into the evolution of cooperation.We used time perspective (TP), a concept reflecting individual differences in orientation towards past, present, or future, and relevant for making sustainable choices.We developed a personalitydriven agent-based model that explores the role of personality in the outcomes of social dilemmas and includes multiple facets of diversity: (1) The agents have different behavior strategies: individual differences derived by applying cluster analysis to survey data from 22 countries (N = 10,940) and resulting in 7 cross-cultural profiles of TP; (2) The non-uniform distribution of the types of agents across countries; (3) The diverse interactions between the agents; and (4) diverse responses to those interactions in a well-mixed population. As one of the results, we introduced an index of overall cooperation for each of the 22 countries, which was validated against cultural, economic, and sustainability indicators (HDI, dimensions of national culture, and Environment Performance Index). It was associated with higher human development, higher individualism, lower power distance, and better environmental performance. The findings illustrate how individual differences in TP can be simulated to predict the ways people in different countries solve the personal vs. common gain dilemma in the global limited-resource situation. This interdisciplinary approach to social simulation can be adopted to explain the possible causes of global environmental issues and to predict their possible outcomes. © 2015 Sircova et al.",,"Article; cluster analysis; controlled study; cooperation; cultural anthropology; data analysis; geographic distribution; health care planning; health care utilization; health survey; human; interdisciplinary communication; interdisciplinary research; personality; population research; resource management; social behavior; social interaction; socioeconomics; statistical model; sustainable development; health care planning; human relation; social environment; theoretical model; Cluster Analysis; Health Resources; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Models, Theoretical; Social Environment",,"Public Library of Science",,,,,19326203,,POLNC,"English","PLoS ONE",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924401916

It never had integrative capacity, but in recent years accumulated the integration potential in regional relations. The common position formation principles in international policy are being carried out by the Visegrad Four. Notable is the emergence of really important issues and explicit politicization of the agenda. The defense theme, the problem of energy security, coordination of positions on the EU budget etc. were included into discussions. At the same time, exacerbated contradictions exist in these areas. Key factors currently affecting the development of the Visegrad Group are: The confrontation of great powers in the region, the inert nature of relationship between the Visegrad countries and the United States, the anarchy in European policy, the prevalence of extra-regional conditions and incentives, the lack of specifi c regional rules and the void of its institutionalization. The Ukrainian crisis once again emphasizes the importance of the regional policy external actors - the U.S., Germany, Russia and the Brussels EU bureaucracy. It was the cause of the schism emerging in East European politics, and slowed down the process of the intra-regional incentives formation as well as of the communications concentration. It is forcing the Visegrad countries to grasp their limitrophe position. A perspective of the Visegrad partnership is unclear, but it is noteworthy that regional relations become increasingly important for their participants.","Central and Eastern Europe.; EU; European security; Foreign policy of Poland; Ukrainian crisis; Visegrad Group",,,"Primakov National Research Institute",,,,,01312227,,,"Russian","World Economy Int.

By analyzing these appointments we can detect which party branches have been captured by regional governors or other influential regional groups. The conclusions of our analysis throw new light on the degree of centralization within UR and the consolidation of the party at the regional level. As we demonstrate, in a number of regions, UR is politically fragmented and regional factions within the party have successfully checked the powers of governors and their ability to exercise control over the appointment of UR regional secretaries.",,"centralization; elite politics; federal system; party politics; political power; regional politics; Russian Federation",,"Heldref Publications",,,,,10746846,,,"English","Demokratizatsyia",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017346490

Speranskaya who compares the Russian model of banking with the Chinese one [1]. The author looks at government banking and the relevance of banks for the non-financial economy and concludes that banking models in China and Russia are different. Since the time of that publication, the Russian government has increased its presence in the credit system as regulator, strategic planner and service provider. The authorities have pursued the industrial policy aimed at nurturing a few “national champions” [2] and increased the degree of interference in the lending decisions of banks. The new evidence suggests reverting to the question raised by T. Speranskaya, namely whether Russia really abandoned the Chinese path of state capitalism in the banking sector as opposed to the industrial sectors.

Current evidence suggests that the forced redirection of attention can modulate preattentive stages of auditory processing. We propose a hypothesis that similar mechanisms may be responsible for spontaneous attentional lapses. To address this issue, the auditory condensation task was used. Four target auditory stimuli that differed in 2 independent features were presented randomly with equal probability. Participants were instructed to respond to each stimulus by pressing 1 of 2 buttons according to a rule based on stimulus feature conjunction. Participants made errors in 10.2% ±.7% of the trials and response omissions in 5.4% ±.5% of the trials. The P2 amplitude was greater in trials with errors compared with correct responses, possibly reflecting a reduction of stimulus processing. Spontaneous attentional performance lapses may be tentatively explained by the inadequate distribution of attentional resources caused by competition with other mental processes, such as mind-wandering. This competition is likely to occasionally subdue early preattentional stages of stimulus processing and thus cause behavioral errors. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Attention; Attentional lapses; ERP; P2; Performance","adult; amplitude modulation; Article; attention; attention disturbance; auditory condensation task; auditory evoked potential; auditory stimulation; electroencephalography; electrophysiology; experimental behavioral test; female; hearing test; human; human experiment; male; pure tone audiometry; questionnaire; spontaneous attentional performance lapse; task performance; visual feedback; young adult",,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,19843054,,,"English","Psychol.

The process interpolates between two extremal cases: the TASEP with parallel update and the process with all particles irreversibly merging into a single cluster moving as an isolated particle. We are interested in the large time behavior of this process on a ring in the whole range of the parameter λ controlling the interaction. We study the stationary state correlations, the cluster size distribution, and the large-time fluctuations of integrated particle current. When λ is finite, we find the usual TASEP-like behavior: The correlation length is finite; there are only clusters of finite size in the stationary state and current fluctuations belong to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. When λ grows with the system size, so does the correlation length. We find a nontrivial transition regime with clusters of all sizes on the lattice.

Contributing to the debate about neural mechanisms underlying regular and irregular inflectional morphology processing in the mental lexicon, we conducted an fMRI experiment in which participants generated forms from different types of Russian verbs and nouns as well as from nonce stimuli. The data were subjected to a whole brain voxel-wise analysis of context dependent changes in functional connectivity [the so-called psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis]. Unlike previously reported subtractive results that reveal functional segregation between brain areas, PPI provides complementary information showing how these areas are functionally integrated in a particular task. To date, PPI evidence on inflectional morphology has been scarce and only available for inflectionally impoverished English verbs in a same-different judgment task. Using PPI here in conjunction with a production task in an inflectionally rich language, we found that functional connectivity between the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and bilateral superior temporal gyri (STG) was significantly greater for regular real verbs than for irregular ones. Furthermore, we observed a significant positive covariance between the number of mistakes in irregular real verb trials and the increase in functional connectivity between the LIFG and the right anterior cingulate cortex in these trails, as compared to regular ones. Our results therefore allow for dissociation between regularity and processing difficulty effects. These results, on the one hand, shed new light on the functional interplay within the LIFG-bilateral STG language-related network and, on the other hand, call for partial reconsideration of some of the previous findings while stressing the role of functional temporo-frontal connectivity in complex morphological processes. © 2015 Li, Huang, Han, Zhang, Lai, Yuan, Luand Zeng.","Dual-route theories; FMRI; Fronto-temporal brain network; Functional connectivity; Inflectional morphology; Psycho–physiological interactions; Russian; Single-route theories","adult; anterior cingulate; Article; brain region; connectome; decision making; female; frontotemporal brain network; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; inferior frontal gyrus; language ability; language processing; male; normal human; psychophysiologic assessment; psychophysiological interaction analysis; speech intelligibility; superior temporal gyrus",,"Frontiers Media S.

To model the appearance of the regions, color, a relatively high dimensional feature, should be handled effectively. A full color histogram is usually too sparse to be reliable. One approach is to explicitly reduce dimensionality by clustering or quantizing the color space. Another popular approach is to fit GMMs for soft implicit clustering of the color space. These approaches work well when the foreground/background are sufficiently distinct. In cases of more subtle difference in appearance, both approaches may reduce or even eliminate foreground/background distinction. This happens because either color clustering is performed completely independently from the segmentation process, as a preprocessing step (in clustering), or independently for the foreground and independently for the background (in GMM). We propose to make clustering an integral part of segmentation, by including a new clustering term in the energy function. Our energy function with a clustering term favours clusterings that make foreground/background appearance more distinct. Thus our energy function jointly optimizes over color clustering, foreground/background models, and segmentation. Exact optimization is not feasible, therefore we develop an approximate algorithm. We show the advantage of including the color clustering term into the energy function on camouflage images, as well as standard segmentation datasets. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Color; Computer vision; Image segmentation; Approximate algorithms; Energy functions; Energy optimization; Foreground/background; High dimensional feature; Joint optimization; Pre-processing step; Segmentation process; Color image processing","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15th IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, ICCV 2015","11 December 2015 through 18 December 2015",,119541,15505499,9781467383912,PICVE,"English","Proc IEEE Int Conf Comput Vision",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973902115

Brain tissues are suspected to accumulate genetic heterogeneity as a result of the retroelements somatic activity. This study aims to expand our understanding of the role retroelements play in generating somatic mosaicism of neural tissues. Whole-genome Alu and L1 profiling of genomic DNA extracted from the cerebellum, frontal cortex, subventricular zone, dentate gyrus, and the myocardium revealed hundreds of somatic insertions in each of the analyzed tissues. Interestingly, the highest concentration of such insertions was detected in the dentate gyrus-the hotspot of adult neurogenesis. Insertions of retroelements and their activity could produce genetically diverse neuronal subsets, which can be involved in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. © 2015 Kurnosov et al.",,"adult; animal cell; Article; brain function; cell proliferation; cerebellum; controlled study; dentate gyrus; DNA extraction; frontal cortex; gene insertion; gene mapping; gene sequence; genetic heterogeneity; heart muscle; high throughput sequencing; human; human genome; human tissue; lateral brain ventricle; long terminal repeat; mosaicism; mouse; nervous system development; neural stem cell; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; promoter region; retroposon; somatic cell; somatic mutation; stem cell; subventricular zone; variable number of tandem repeat; brain; genetics; long interspersed repeat; nerve cell; nervous system development; physiology; Brain; Dentate Gyrus; Genome, Human; Humans; Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements; Neurogenesis; Neurons; Promoter Regions, Genetic",,"Public Library of Science",,,,,19326203,,POLNC,"English","PLoS ONE",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923290191

(1992) and can be defined as follows. A representation of an n-vertex graph G is said to be implicit if it assigns to each vertex of G a binary code of length O(logn) so that the adjacency of two vertices is a function of their codes. Since an implicit representation of an n-vertex graph uses O(nlogn) bits, any class of graphs admitting such a representation contains 2O(nlogn) labelled graphs with n vertices. In the terminology of Balogh et al. (2000) such classes have at most factorial speed of growth. In this terminology, the implicit graph conjecture can be stated as follows: every class with at most factorial speed of growth which is hereditary admits an implicit representation. The question of deciding whether a given hereditary class has at most factorial speed of growth is far from being trivial. In the present paper, we introduce a number of tools simplifying this question. Some of them can be used to obtain a stronger conclusion on the existence of an implicit representation. We apply our tools to reveal new hereditary classes with the factorial speed of growth. For many of them we show the existence of an implicit representation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The investigation begins with its origins in the budgetary reform and, widely, the concept of New Public Management. The paper also examines the so called evaluation waves, stages of development and methods that have been used at each stage. At present, the government effectiveness evaluation is associated directly with strategic planning and finances. The main question is: to what extent the results obtained impact on further decisions, do the evaluations affect future budgets and policy implementation plans? Special attention is paid to American experience, since the USA is the leader in development and implementation of effective governmental practices. During a long history of such practices in the United States they have undergone numerous significant changes. However, this issue is very complicated and is not fully resolved even at present. The US experience is highly relevant and useful for Russia, where the public administration reform is still important. In Russia there are both projects and measures corresponding with the world tendencies in the government effectiveness evaluation field. At the same time, the adoption of foreign institutions may lead to negative results. The future of evaluation practices in Russia, on federal and regional level, pivots on development of relevant homegrown institutions and mechanisms in compliance with positive and negative international experience.","Effectiveness; Evaluation; Governance; Public administration; USA",,,"Primakov National Research Institute",,,,,01312227,,,"Russian","World Economy Int.

The absence of a consensus on its melting temperature at normal conditions has been considered as a technical problem that motivated more and more sophisticated experiments. The experimental evidences of the maximum on the graphite melting curve resulted in the liquid-liquid phase transition hypothesis for liquid carbon. However this hypothesis still requires a sound evidence. In this work using atomistic methods we focus on the kinetics of graphite melting and show that the experimental puzzles can be resolved by considering the graphite melting as a process in the non-equilibrium superheated solid. The unusually slow melting kinetics results in the existence of the superheated graphite at the microsecond timescale and thus biases the measurements of its equilibrium melting temperature. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Attainment of formal education is widely reported to have a negative gradient with risk factors and onset of chronic disease, yet there has not been a formal assessment of this research. A random-effects meta-analysis finds that across 414 published effects more education significantly reduces the likelihood of chronic disease, except for neoplastic diseases with substantial genetic causes. Some studies, however, report null effects and other research on infectious disease report positive education gradients. Instead of assuming these contradictory results are spurious, it is suggested that they are part of a predictable systemic interaction between multiple mediating effects of education and the Epidemiological Transition stage of the population; and thus represent one case of the Population Education Transition Curve modeling changes in the association between education and health as dependent on population context. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Chronic disease; Education; Epidemiological Transition; Heterogeneous effects; Meta analysis; Population education transition curve","developing world; disease; educational attainment; epidemiology; heterogeneous medium; meta-analysis; mortality; risk factor; Article; behavior disorder; chronic disease; endocrine disease; health behavior; health education; health status; human; life expectancy; malignant neoplastic disease; mental disease; metabolic disorder; population dynamics; Population Education Transition Curve; risk factor; sensitivity analysis; systematic review; vascular disease; chronic disease; educational status; genetic predisposition; health disparity; health status; mental health; meta analysis; Neoplasms; social determinants of health; socioeconomics; Chronic Disease; Educational Status; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Health Status; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Life Expectancy; Mental Health; Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Social Determinants of Health; Socioeconomic Factors",,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,02779536,,SSMDE,"English","Soc.

Our results suggest that the pressure component of the Lamb wave decreases exponentially upwards near the layer with an extremum of sound speed. We find that local wave disturbances of the wave pressure component are formed in the resonance layer at which the horizontal phase velocity is equal to the sound speed. These resonance layers are the reason for a filtration of atmospheric disturbances.

The total free energy of the dilute polymer solution is expressed as a function of the radius of gyration of the polymer and the average solvent number density within the gyration volume at the level of the mean-field approximation. Varying the strength of attraction between polymer and solvent we show that two qualitatively different regimes occur at the liquid-gas critical point. In case of weak polymer-solvent interactions the polymer chain is in a globular state. On the contrary, in case of strong polymer-solvent interactions the polymer chain attains an expanded conformation. We discuss the influence of the critical solvent density fluctuations on the polymer conformation. The reported effect could be used to excert control on the polymer conformation by changing the thermodynamic state of the solvent. It could also be helpful to estimate the solvent density within the gyration volume of the polymer for drug delivery and molecular imprinting applications. © CopyrightEPLA, 2015.",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing",,,,,02955075,,,"English","EPL",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923382210

Despite many theoretical studies, the effects of topological constraints on the equilibrium state of a single compact polymer have not been systematically studied. Here we use simulations to address this longstanding problem. We find that sufficiently long unknotted polymers differ from knotted ones in the spatial and topological states of their subchains. The unknotted globule has subchains that are mostly unknotted and form asymptotically compact RG(s) ∼ s1/3 crumples. However, crumples display a high fractal dimension of the surface db = 2.8, forming excessive contacts and interpenetrating each other. We conclude that this topologically constrained equilibrium state resembles a conjectured crumpled globule [Grosberg et al., Journal de Physique, 1988, 49, 2095], but differs from its idealized hierarchy of self-similar, isolated and compact crumples.

This λ is a modification of the standard maximal Lyapunov exponent. It is computed here as a function of embedding dimension m, within four-year time windows centered at the maxima of Schwabe cycles. The λ(m) curves form separate clusters (pre-1923 and post-1933). This supports a regime transition and narrows its occurrence to cycle 16, preceding the growth of activity leading to the Modern Maximum. The two regimes are reproduced by a simple autoregressive process AR(1), with the mean of Poisson noise undergoing 11 yr modulation. The autocorrelation a of the process (linked to sunspot lifetime) is a 0.8 for 1850-1923 and 0.95 for 1933-2013. The AR(1) model suggests that groups of spots appear with a Poisson rate and disappear at a constant rate. We further applied the irregularity index to the daily sunspot group number series for the northern and southern hemispheres, provided by the Greenwich Royal Observatory (RGO), in order to study a possible desynchronization. Correlations between the north and south λ(m) curves vary quite strongly with time and indeed show desynchronization. This may reflect a slow change in the dimension of an underlying dynamical system. The ISSN and RGO series of group numbers do not imply an identical mechanism, but both uncover a regime change at a similar time. Computation of the irregularity index near the maximum of cycle 24 will help in checking whether yet another regime change is under way. © 2015. The American Astronomical Society.

In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) we estimated yearly deaths for 188 countries between 1990, and 2013. We used the results to assess whether there is epidemiological convergence across countries. Methods We estimated age-sex-specific all-cause mortality using the GBD 2010 methods with some refinements to improve accuracy applied to an updated database of vital registration, survey, and census data. We generally estimated cause of death as in the GBD 2010. Key improvements included the addition of more recent vital registration data for 72 countries, an updated verbal autopsy literature review, two new and detailed data systems for China, and more detail for Mexico, UK, Turkey, and Russia. We improved statistical models for garbage code redistribution. We used six different modelling strategies across the 240 causes; cause of death ensemble modelling (CODEm) was the dominant strategy for causes with sufficient information. Trends for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias were informed by meta-regression of prevalence studies. For pathogen-specific causes of diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections we used a counterfactual approach. We computed two measures of convergence (inequality) across countries: the average relative difference across all pairs of countries (Gini coefficient) and the average absolute difference across countries. To summarise broad findings, we used multiple decrement life-tables to decompose probabilities of death from birth to exact age 15 years, from exact age 15 years to exact age 50 years, and from exact age 50 years to exact age 75 years, and life expectancy at birth into major causes. For all quantities reported, we computed 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). We constrained cause-specific fractions within each age-sex-country-year group to sum to all-cause mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions. Findings Global life expectancy for both sexes increased from 65·3 years (UI 65·0-65·6) in 1990, to 71·5 years (UI 71·0-71·9) in 2013, while the number of deaths increased from 47·5 million (UI 46·8-48·2) to 54·9 million (UI 53·6-56·3) over the same interval. Global progress masked variation by age and sex: for children, average absolute differences between countries decreased but relative differences increased. For women aged 25-39 years and older than 75 years and for men aged 20-49 years and 65 years and older, both absolute and relative differences increased. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed the prominent role of reductions in age-standardised death rates for cardiovascular diseases and cancers in high-income regions, and reductions in child deaths from diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and neonatal causes in low-income regions. HIV/AIDS reduced life expectancy in southern sub-Saharan Africa. For most communicable causes of death both numbers of deaths and age-standardised death rates fell whereas for most non-communicable causes, demographic shifts have increased numbers of deaths but decreased age-standardised death rates. Global deaths from injury increased by 10·7%, from 4·3 million deaths in 1990 to 4·8 million in 2013; but age-standardised rates declined over the same period by 21%. For some causes of more than 100 000 deaths per year in 2013, age-standardised death rates increased between 1990 and 2013, including HIV/AIDS, pancreatic cancer, atrial fibrillation and flutter, drug use disorders, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and sickle-cell anaemias. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, neonatal causes, and malaria are still in the top five causes of death in children younger than 5 years. The most important pathogens are rotavirus for diarrhoea and pneumococcus for lower respiratory infections. Country-specific probabilities of death over three phases of life were substantially varied between and within regions. Interpretation For most countries, the general pattern of reductions in age-sex specific mortality has been associated with a progressive shift towards a larger share of the remaining deaths caused by non-communicable disease and injuries. Assessing epidemiological convergence across countries depends on whether an absolute or relative measure of inequality is used. Nevertheless, age-standardised death rates for seven substantial causes are increasing, suggesting the potential for reversals in some countries. Important gaps exist in the empirical data for cause of death estimates for some countries; for example, no national data for India are available for the past decade.

The paper points to the discrepancy between the engineering concept of energy efficiency and the energy intensity as it is understood in macroeconomic statistics. This double discrepancy concerns definitions (while engineering concept of energy efficiency is based on the thermodynamic definition, energy intensity includes economic measures) and use. With regard to the latter, the authors conclude that energy intensity can only provide indirect and delayed evidence of technological and engineering energy efficiency of energy conversion processes, which entails shortcomings for management and policymaking. Therefore, we suggest to stop considering subsectoral, sectoral and other levels of energy intensities as aggregates of lower-level energy efficiency. It is suggested that the insufficiency of energy intensity indicators can be compensated with the introduction of thermodynamic indicators describing energy efficiency at the physical, technological, enterprise, sub-sector, sectoral and national levels without references to any economic or financial parameters. Structured statistical data on thermodynamic efficiency is offered as a better option for identifying break-through technologies and technological bottle-necks that constrain efficiency advancements. It is also suggested that macro-level thermodynamic indicators should be based on the thermodynamic first law efficiency and the energy quality problem may be left to enterprise-level thermoeconomic optimization. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy efficiency; Energy intensity; Energy management; Thermodynamics","Bottles; Economics; Energy management; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Thermodynamics; Energy intensity; Engineering concepts; Equivalent measure; Financial parameters; First law efficiency; Thermodynamic efficiency; Thermodynamic indicators; Thermoeconomic optimization; Energy efficiency; data set; econometrics; energy efficiency; energy planning; energy policy; macroeconomics; thermodynamics",,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,03062619,,APEND,"English","Appl.

Social environment is usually considered as a randomly formed group. However, it forms and develops as a result of an individual conscious dynamic choice. Students may initially choose friends among peers with similar level of academic performance, and the influence of close friends on each other's achievements may reveal itself over time. Using stochastic actor- based models, we demarcated the boundaries between social selection and social influence evaluated through academic performance. Having analyzed the dynamics of friendship ties and academic achievements throughout the first year at university, we discovered that students were not guided by the level of academic performance when choosing friends among peers but academic achievements of the latter affected their own performance over time. This could be explained by social segregation of students based on their academic outcomes.","Academic achievement; Academic outcomes; Academic performance; Dynamic statistical models; Effects of co-learning; Friendship ties; Higher education; Social networks; Stochastic actor-based models",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

In Study 2, the construct validity and reliability of the Russian version of the in-group identification measure was examined. Results show that these measures have adequate psychometric properties. In short, our results show that Leach et al.'s model is reproduced in Russian culture.

Rowe. The study aimed to assess the reformist potential of Russian school principals. We believe that this potential is determined in the present context by the leadership style which suggests cooperation with teachers in decision-making processes and delegating them responsibilities under conditions of uncertainty and high cognitively complex tasks. Using the two-factor leadership model proposed by Bernard M. Bass, we suggest that either transformational or transactional leadership style may be efficient depending on school situation. Consequently, two types of leaders may be the most efficient in terms of school reformation: (1) principals with the conceptual decision-making style as dominant and the analy tical one as backup- they are ready to make changes and are likely already implementing them; (2) principals with the analytical leadership style as dominant and the conceptual one as backup-they are potentially prepared to adapt under changing conditions or if required to change by external influences. Assessment of the reformist potential among the existing school principal staff in Russia shows only 12% of school principals in eight regions apply the conceptual decision-making style having a backup analytical style- it's them who can be classified as transformational leaders. Only 11% will implement changes efficiently under a specific context-those are transactional leaders who are likely to change their leadership style for transformational one.","Decision-making styles; Reformist potential of the education system; School leadership; School principals; Transformational leadership",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

The social capital accumulated by users increases the community commitment and cohesion by interpreting gifts as a set of resources to distribute fairly.

This makes them especially useful for the rapid visual categorization of multiple objects of different types that are intermixed in space. Rapid categorization implies our ability to judge at one brief glance whether all visible objects represent different types or just variants of one type. A framework presented here states that processes resembling statistical tests can underlie that categorization. At an early stage (primary categorization), when independent ensemble properties are distributed along a single sensory dimension, the shape of that distribution is tested in order to establish whether all features can be represented by a single or multiple peaks. When primary categories are separated, the visual system either reiterates the shape test to recognize subcategories (indepth processing) or implements mean comparison tests to match several primary categories along a new dimension.

These schools were aimed at informing parents of hygiene and health. The second stage is emergence of trainings designed for development of parental competence and skills in 1960-s. Finally, the contemporary trend in educational programs for parents is programs which deal with personal traits of a parent, and in particular with parental self-efficacy. Theoretical and empirical basis for using self-efficacy as a core concept in educational programs for parents is provided. At the second part of the article we briefly describe an educational program for parents which we have developed and results of our empirical study of factors affecting parental self-efficacy which we used as a basis. In line with Bandura's theory of self-efficacy it turned out that maternal self-efficacy is negatively associated with the extent to which there is a disagreement in parenting practices between a mother and her relatives and friends. So we argue that improving parents ability to build conflict-free relationships, negotiate or resist criticism from others is an essential part of educational programs for parents aimed at developing parental self-efficacy.","Educational programs for parents; Parental self-efficacy; Self-efficacy; Social support; Trainings",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

When discussing these topics, philosophers often resort to certain thought experiments, engaging an important concept that can be broadly identified as ""the global observer."" It relates to Putnam's God's Eye, Davidson's Omniscient Interpreter, and the ultimate observer in quantum physics, among others. Problem: The article explores the notion of the global observer as the guarantor of the determinability and configuration of events in the world. It analyzes the consistency of the notion ""global observer"" from the standpoint of logic and philosophy, and discusses why application of this notion in some contexts poses challenges and appears to be paradoxical. Method: The paper uses conceptual methods of argumentation, such as logical (deduction) and philosophical (phenomenology) kinds of proof. Its key approach is the engagement of thought experiments. Results: The notion of a global observer is incoherent: ""being global"" and ""being an observer"" appear to be incompatible features. It is claimed that from the standpoint of global observation, there are no events occurring in the world. Furthermore, the indefiniteness of the world as a whole is asserted, which is related to the uninformedness of the global observer regarding the ""true state of affairs."" ""Global observation"" turns out to be incompatible with the concept of the observer, blocking, as a result, the opportunity for a determinable configuration of events. It only makes sense to discuss local observations, which are limited to mutual observation or introspections, and not to assume the existence of some absolute truth, reality, or the state of affairs beyond the local observations. Constructivist content: The article emphasizes the role of the observer and observation. It opens up some problematic consequences of the core philosophical assumptions of globally observing existence. Referring to von Foerster's and Luhmann's idea that we can only speak reasonably about local observations, the paper argues that reality is neither external to nor independent of the observer. Implications: The paper could be productive for epistemic theories, theories of quantum physics, and theories of non-classical logic.","Event; Global observer; Ideal observer; Limited observer; Local observer; Omniscient interpreter; Omniscient observer; Truth; Ultimate observer",,,"Vrije Universiteit Brussel",,,,,1782348X,,,"English","Constr.

While usually the predicates are classified on the basis whether they can potentially be used with dative subject, I study the trends for explicit use of dative (or prepositional beneficiary arguments) among the ""dative subject predicates"", and show that the frequency rates of real use of dative subjects can be very different with different predicates. Separate analysis of different morphological forms of the same dative subject lexeme (i.e. adjectives in full and short forms, comparative adjectives and predicatives) shows that they may also exhibit different strategies with explicit dative subjects.

Historically, the particle by in conjunctions can be traced back to the marker of subjunctive. Synchronically, however, the group is not homogenous. The aim of the paper is to find out which of the conjunctions with by should be considered as containing the marker of subjunctive, and test whether the particle can or can not be separated from the conjunction. Four criteria are used. The first and the second, namely, (a) the forms available in the subordinate clause with the conjunction and (b) the possibility of repetition of the particle by with the second predicate shows that comparative conjunctions do not synchronically contain the subjunctive marker.

Revealing the approaches of historians to this subject, the methods and manner of their work with historical sources, the author demonstrates the negative consequences that were a result of political topicality and the concealing of information about the state. A review of historiographic heritage enables the author to cleanse the perception of the topic from a number of ""quasi-evident facts"" created at various times and under different circumstances. Additionally, she pays attention to the existence of a vast number of documents of the police department which can still be found in state archives. Special attention needs to be paid to those ones that contain the reflections of gendarme officers on professional ethics and duties. The author reveals documental evidence of conflicts of interest between the local administration and the police officers controlling its activity. The approach used by the author bears a non-conventional character which consists in the study of creation of these documents and their functions in the police department. Preliminary results enable the author to claim that these certificates can provide information not only about the sphere of impact and peculiarities of the secret police, but also about the ways of implementation of the political concept of a regular, well-organized state in 19th century-Russia and the ways of self-improvement of government.","Corps of Gendarmes; Management modernization; Russian empire; Third Section of H.

But the progress has been uneven. The P4M has not served to help transform the EU–Russia relations into a truly strategic partnership.

Second, it has a look at the expectations of the P4M at its launch. Third, it focuses on the progress the P4M has made so far and its relationship with the EU–Russia CSs by comparing the narratives of both. It explores in particular how the P4M has advanced by sectors and whether it has helped advance or has the potential to advance the EU–Russia CS dialogues.

The analysis focused on the narratives about student attrition and its causes and revealed the generally accusing nature of professors' discourses. All narratives can be integrated and described under the metaphor of a trial. In the most blatant form, the discourse is constructed in a prosecutor style, but attorney- and judge-like speeches also blame students for the high attrition rates. All the three types of discourse build figurative barriers between the university and professors on the one hand and students on the other. These barriers encourage professors to feel uninvolved in student attrition. None of the discourse types phrased the university mission or problematized the principles and goals of university activities. We suggest that the ""bad student"" discourse reflects some real problems associated with massification of education and with inevitable changes to the student body. Professor discourse analysis makes it possible to assume that response to these changes is restricted to stating the problems and disassociating oneself from them. Construction of figurative barriers may result in professors' self-distancing not only from students but also from the changes affecting the education system. Such self-distancing complicates the process of adaptation to changes, making it poorly controllable.","Discourse analysis; Education reformation; Higher education; Student attrition; University mission",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

We estimate peer influence on student choice of specialization using data on undergraduate students of a Russian university. Information about individual social ties has been gathered from a questionnaire survey. We show that specialization choice is significantly influenced by friends as well as by study partners. The strongest effect is produced by friends who are study partners and those who have similar academic achievements. Reciprocal friendship ties have a stronger influence on the choice than nonreciprocal ones. Also, the decision is affected by classmates with similar academic achievement. The results allow us to better understand the mechanisms of peer effects in the specialization choice. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","higher education; peer effects; social networks; specialization choice","academic performance; decision making; higher education; learning; social network; student; Russian Federation",,"Routledge",,,,,00036846,,,"English","Appl.

The paper provides the results of assessing the current situation with competition in the market of Russian universities using a non-structural method, namely an adjusted Panzar-Rosse competition assessment model. As one of the model factors, we used the cost of grants gained by universities as a part of governmental orders. We also analyzed the effects of other factors describing the size, entrance requirements, and research activity of universities. The article discovers how university income depends on the cost of grants received (a ratio of total income to the size of grants) and on the number of students and teachers.

This is especially salient in countries like Russia, where smoking is one of the top public health threats and causes of population decline. As such, critical analysis of the message effectiveness of Russia’s anti-smoking campaign is warranted. This study employs frame analysis to examine the anti-smoking messages embedded in the sections of Federal Law No. 15 that regulate the information and communication campaigns. The study’s results illustrate that in addition to the lack of a comprehensive, effective public relations campaign promoting smoking cessation, the rhetoric guiding the enforcement of the anti-smoking legislation enforcement is doomed to yield desired results.

They are used for evaluating imprecision (or non-specificity) contained in information described by monotone (non-additive) measures. These indices can be considered as generalizations of the generalized Hartley measure. We argue that in some cases, for example in approximation problems, the application of imprecision indices is well justified comparing with well-known uncertainty measures because of their good sensitivity. In the paper, we investigate properties of so called linear imprecision indices; in particular, we introduce their various representations and describe connections to the theory of imprecise probabilities. We also study the algebraic structure of imprecision indices in the linear space and describe the extreme points of the convex set of all possible imprecision indices, in particular, of imprecision indices with symmetrical properties. We also show how to measure inconsistency in information by impression indices. At the end of the paper, we consider the application of imprecision indices in analysing the applicability of different aggregation rules in evidence theory. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","applicability of aggregation rules in evidence theory; imprecision indices; lower and upper probabilities; uncertainty-based information","Information systems; Algebraic structures; Approximation problems; Evidence theories; Imprecise probabilities; imprecision indices; Lower and upper probabilities; Uncertainty measures; Uncertainty-based information; Set theory",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",,,,,03081079,,IJGSA,"English","Int J Gen Syst",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941737826

Law concept had various interpretations in pre-revolutionary theory of state and law. The only common principle was the fact of its sanctioning by the monarch, the so-called ""highest approval"" both written and verbal. In other words, no right was to determine the law, but the political will, which formed the right itself, based on the political and social-economical current state of affairs. The main emphasis is placed on distinctive characteristics of lawmaking, namely that the main landmarks of the country's history were embodied in the legislature, and the fact that the highest Government bodies were involved in the process. The main forms of the Russian Empire's legislature including the ones in the sphere of education- a Manifest (manifesto decree), Ukaz (decree), povelenie (expression of the will), mnenie (opinion) of the Council of State, polozhenie (position) of the Committee of Ministers, vsepodanneishii (""humble"") report of the Minister, rescript, the law-were primarily set at the beginning of the XIX century, and existed without significant changes up to 1917. Special attention is given to the analysis of the main Government bodies (State Council, the Committee of Ministers or Council of Ministers, State Duma). Materials display the data on the legislature as such, as well as multiple administrative rulings in the sphere of education-main purpose being to reflect the intent, goals, ideology and means of carrying out the reforms, proposed by various legislative acts.

When solemnly entering a city, the riding prince used to be surrounded by criminals, previously convicted by local courts and sentenced to exile. He brought these convicts with him back into the city from which they had been expelled. This form of amnesty used to be explained by many German scholars mostly in terms of the 'sacred kingship' (Sakralkönigtum) as deriving from the charisma of ancient Germanic chieftains or late Roman emperors. They appealed also to the Sachsenspiegel and Schwabespiegel, as if these law books could reveal the basic juridical norms that made it possible for the princes to grant their pardon to exiled criminals. The article argues that the custom had nothing in common either with Roman emperors, ancient chieftains and 'sacred kingship', or with the 'Mirrors'-both these habitual explanations are in fact nothing more than historiographical myths. The author claims that this highly impressive element of royal and princely representation did not even emerge in Germany but was borrowed there only in the late middle ages from an alien royal tradition, and for its roots one should in fact look not to kings but rather to bishops. © The Author 2015.

In this work, De Raey provided a theory of the formation and meaning language based on the metaphysics of Rene Descartes. De Raey distinguished between words signifying passions and sensations, ideas of the intellect, or external things. The aim of this article is to shift away the discussion of De Raey's critique on the application of the language of practical matters by Lodewijk Meijer and Spinoza, and to redirect modern interpretations to the originality of De Raey's own reflections on the uses of language. In his linguistic thought, De Raey criticized philosophers such as Hobbes, who supposedly deprived Aristotelian terminology of any reference and meaningful use. The analysis of De Raey testifies to the emergence of the philosophy of language out of the double traditions of logic and metaphysics. It is to be interpreted as an effect of the emergence of an alternative worldview to Aristotelianism.

The study is based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis of references to international institutions in the BRICS documents, identifying and examining the models, intensity and distribution of interactions. The findings of the study suggest that the dynamics of BRICS engagement with other international institutions is positive. However, despite the increase in the absolute number of references, a decrease in their intensity is observed. This trend persists in spite of the expansion of BRICS agenda and the establishment of cooperation mechanisms involving BRICS and other international institutions in new areas. BRICS engagement with international institutions is characterized by two basic models: the ""catalyst"" approach and ""parallel treatment"". In addition, BRICS countries use mechanisms for coordinating their positions in international institutions on issues relevant to their agenda and broader policy areas. The establishment of the BRICS own institutions has not led to a noticeable decrease in the number and intensity of references to other international organizations. Thus, the BRICS and its New Development Bank and Contingent Reserve Arrangement should not be considered as one more tool for the development of multilateralism and coordination rather than alternatives or competitors to the existing international institutions. The analysis leads to the conclusion that to further enhance the effectiveness of global governance mechanisms it is necessary for BRICS to intensify its cooperation with other institutions, giving the priority to leadership in setting their priorities and identifying new areas of work, concrete decisions to support them, delegation of mandates and development of mechanisms for coordinating the positions of the five countries rather than just discussing the institutions' activities.","""catalyst"" approach; ""parallel treatment""; BRICS; International institutions; Models of engagement with international institutions",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,19967845,,,"English","Int.

I analyze the narratives of young women through their conception of the image of the body. My research shows that the girls' experience does not contradict their femininity, but neither does it correspond to the image of the defenseless body.

The knowledge of what place attributes are important for a particular group of residents will help to attract relevant target audience by developing important attributes for these groups. Even though place marketing and branding have various tools in creating effective marketing strategies for places, there are still some research gaps. For instance, the question about understanding and measurement, which group of residents can be the most valuable for a specific place, remains unanswered. This question becomes even more complicated when it comes to interregional marketing and branding strategies as two or even more regions unite in order to build up one strong place brand. The answer to this question could help places to build up strong place branding strategies.

This paper describes an ongoing effort to develop a methodology for collaborative ontology construction by geographically spread communities of experts and implement a web-based prototype supporting this methodology. A distinctive feature of the proposed approach is the use of conceptual exploration techniques, which make it possible to organize the process of ontology construction by automatically identifying and explicitly highlighting issues that remain to be addressed. Given a set of objects (facts, situations, etc.) of a subject domain, which is known to have considerably more such objects, and their unified descriptions in terms of presence or absence of certain attributes, a conceptual exploration system maintains a compact representation of implications behind the currently built ontology and offers them for experts to accept or falsify by entering new objects or extending the description language with new attributes. Upon termination, exploration results in identification of a (relatively small) representative part of the domain from which a conceptual hierarchy of the entire domain can be automatically constructed. We consider theoretic, algorithmic, representational, and pragmatic issues of transforming the exploration methods into a toolset useful for domain experts.

This paper explores the impact of CRM systems on the quality of companies' customer understanding.

The fi eld research is based on quantitative data from online questionnaires and telephone interviews. The sample consists of 64 company representatives and 217 ophthalmologists. The authors developed and tested a model of physician loyalty drivers and studied employees' perceptions of the CRM system. The fi ndings of this paper demonstrate that, despite the fact that a CRM system is actively used and perceived as a crucial part of the customer relationship management process within the company, understanding of key customer loyalty drivers needs to be signifi cantly improved. The paper contributes to existing theory by evaluating the link between the use of CRM applications and customer relationship performance as well as by developing a physician prescription loyalty influencers framework in the context of the Russian pharmaceutical market.

Design/methodology/approach – Typology construction was chosen as the main study method. Eight polar place demand patterns were classified on the abstract level, using a set of binary variables of spatial behaviour (migration, natural growth and settling). Based on this typology, eight abstract places were deductively described. In conjunction with this deductive study, the authors conducted focus groups, and the results showed considerable similarity in the interpretation of the achieved types. Findings – This paper arrives at interdependent typologies of place demand, place product and place use patterns that allow the ways of using specific places to be identified and distinctive segments and products to be distinguished as particular, consistent combinations of the achieved types. Practical implications – The typologies obtained expand the scope of competitive analysis and planning in framing place marketing. Distinct uses of specific places unambiguously point to the features of certain segments and could thereby enable a lucid marketing strategy. Originality/value – Empirically driven place market research has not precisely defined the distinct ideas and concepts of investigated places, which might reflect the different segments of the population that have different intentions for the use of these places.

Continuing a series of articles on this subject, the author focuses on the internal rationality of claims about the systemic character of law. This rationality is embedded in the legal thinking of Modernity and reveals itself in the belief in the rational nature of law. According to this style of legal thinking, such internal rationality impedes law from being chaotically or randomly organized and structured. Therefore, law shall have a reasonably organized structure, even if in reality it does not have such a structure. In this way, the belief in an internal rationality of law transforms itself into the requirement for the rational organization of law. These two elements - belief in an internal rationality and the requirement of the rational organization of law - are the pillars of the dogmatic conception of law which was established in Begriffsjurisprudenz of the 19th century and which still holds sway over contemporary continental legal thinking. © 2015, Supporting Academic Initiatives Foundation.

The identification strategy relies on the fact that the primary purpose of Russian colonization was to protect the country's access to warm-water ports. Therefore, settlement varied depending on the proximity to the Black Sea coast. Instrumenting the share of settlers by the distance to the coast, I show the positive impact of settlement on literacy among the indigenous population with long-term effects on income, educational attainment and the quality of local governance. To insure the validity of the instrument, I conduct a placebo test that shows that distance to the coast does not predict literacy and income in the South Caucasus, where Russians had no strategic interest in protecting the coastline.

Self-administrated questionnaire (also web-based) was used in the study. The data for the survey was collected using UNIPARK platform. It was demonstrated that many traditional theories developed in this area need to be revised. A sharp contradiction between actual values of entrepreneurs and public expectations stated in sets of codes and concepts of social responsibility was revealed. It was concluded that the informal corrupt practices exist due to the difficulty of entrepreneurs to comply with public attitudes without restructuring their own value system. © 2015, Econjournals.

Based on the differences of interpretation, the author concludes that there is a significant difference in mentality not only between Russian and foreign lawyers, but also between lawyers in Russia: law enforcers on the one hand and human rights activists, advocates and some independent scientists on the other and, consequently, there are specific criteria for the specialist selection in competent state bodies.

The modes through which these collectives perform resistance involve activist tactics of boycotting, site-specific protests, counter-guides, and whistleblowing and name and shame approaches mixed with performance art and playful interventions. Grappling with the predicaments of work in contemporary art, a labouring practice that does not follow typical processes of valorization and has a contingent object and an extremely loose territorial unity, this article argues that while the identity of the contemporary artist is systemically and conceptually moving towards fluidity and open-endedness, these groups work to re-affirm a collective in whose name it is possible to advance certain claims, assumptions, and demands. The contradictions and dynamics of art workers organizing against internships and voluntary work within a highly individualized, self-exploitative, and often privileged field are useful for informing labour organizing in the framework of ongoing capitalist restructuring. © 2015, Unified Theory of Information Research Group.

The paper starts with a puzzle: if ethnic separation is required for peace, how do some partitions that leave minorities behind maintain peace? The paper compares post-partition Georgia–Abkhazia, which experienced violence renewal within five years of the partition, with post-partition Moldova–Transnistria, which maintained peace. Both countries had ‘staybehind’ ethnic minorities. The paper also disaggregates and compares the territories within post-partition Abkhazia, which contain ethnic Georgians: Lower Gali experienced violence while neighboring Upper Gali did not. The paper argues that state institutions create an incentive for ethnic minorities to collaborate with the state, regardless of minority preferences, and this helps maintain peace. However, preferences become important where institutions are weak and members of the ethnic minority have the opportunity to defect, this increases the likelihood of violence. The results build on the ethnic security dilemma by specifying micro-mechanisms and challenging the theory’s reliance on intransigent ethnic identities in explaining the causes of postpartition violence. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",,,,"Routledge",,,,,13698249,,,"English","Civ.

In this article, data quality between three conditions is compared among children and adolescents 7–15 years old as follows: (1) a text-only survey, (2) a visual survey with an attractive design and images, and (3) a gamified survey. To test a gamification effect, an experiment using a volunteer online access panel in Russia was conducted among 1,050 children. The gamified survey produced completion time more than a third longer than the text-only survey. A higher overall item nonresponse rate was found in both the gamified and visual surveys. However, this was mainly due to the Flash-based questions in these conditions. Fewer respondents straight-lined and used middle responses in the gamified and visual surveys. It was also less burdensome to complete the gamified survey. Children requested help to answer survey questions less often. They found it more enjoyable and easier. Moreover, the subjective evaluation of the completion time was not different from the two other conditions.

The basis for this approach is the static swarm model characterised by the absence of a set control centre; it represents the network fixed at some time interval as a set of locally interacting agents. A task of cooperative hunting by distributed mobile robots based on local interaction was considered. Two strategies were used for the hunting task solution: individual hunting and pack-hunting.

Present in the work of Durkheim and most scholars of the sacred, as well as in actual social practice, the impure sacred is not the profane, the sphere that opposes the sacred. However, in most interpretations of Durkheim, and even in aspects of his own argument, the ambiguity of the sacred is neglected and, in several important cases, treated as if it were profane: this has negative consequences for cultural sociology and the study of culture in contemporary society. In certain cases, the impure sacred and the profane can be hard to tell apart. Yet, if the boundaries between the sacred (pure and impure) and the profane are not clearly distinguished, the overall approach to culture in terms of distinctions and boundaries loses its logical and theoretical coherence. This article elucidates the ambiguity of the sacred and reintegrates that ambiguity into cultural sociology. The model proposed here treats the impure as a transient result of violation of the sacred/profane border with no independent status of its own. © 2013, © The Author(s) 2013.","Ambiguity of the sacred; anthropology; cultural sociology; Durkheim; impure sacred; religion; sacred and profane",,,"SAGE Publications Ltd",,,,,1468795X,,,"English","J.

The paper presents method of visual recognition of player's 3D-model with the use of geometry knowledge of the three-dimensional maze and target sighting with respect to human motor reflexes. The implementation is made in Unreal Engine 4, which provides large variety of methods for programming game agents.","Boosting; Game artificial intelligence; Neural network; Rule-based systems; Sparse network of winnows; Visual recognition","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Automatic target recognition; Computer games; Decision making; Image analysis; Knowledge based systems; Neural networks; Rendering (computer graphics); Boosting; Distributed strategies; Game artificial intelligence; Human behaviors; Human players; Human reaction; Sparse Network of Winnows; Visual recognition; Behavioral research","et al.;Exactpro;GraphiCon;IT Centre;Krasovsky Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics;SKB Kontur;Ural Federal University","CEUR-WS","4th International Conference on Analysis of Images, Social Networks and Texts, AIST 2015","9 April 2015 through 11 April 2015",,116775,16130073,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84950109693

It begins by comparing the key multilateral development banks (World Bank, Asian Development Bank, African Development Bank and Inter-American Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) and national development banks of the BRICS countries with the newly established institution. The NDB's purpose is to mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in the member countries. This purpose, as author concludes on the base of the analysis, partly duplicates the work of the existing institutions. However, the NDB could add to the functions of the existing institutions and become a significant development bank for its members. The best way to achieve this significance is to implement multilateral projects in the areas mentioned above. The article also examines the current role of the BRICS countries in the global financial architecture and the potential for an increased role, brought by the establishment of the BRICS bank. The founding countries of the NDB will jointly determine the volume and directions of its financial aid. In addition, in contrast to the Bretton Woods institutions, the BRICS countries can change the rules of the development financial aid, particularly the conditions and system for monitoring results. The article concludes that the BRICS countries have created a possible way to change the current system of development finance and therefore to increase the role of the BRICS countries in the global financial architecture.","BRICS; Development finance; Global financial architecture; New development bank; Sustainable development",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,19967845,,,"Russian","Int.

Though in the first wave of the study respondents found it more enjoyable and easier to complete the gamified survey, no differences in participation rates were found between the conditions in the second wave. Contrary to expectations, a higher breakoff was found in the gamified condition. Moreover, it produced lower test-retest reliability correlations than the text-only and visual conditions in all survey questions.

Despite heavy criticism that came down on the Constitutional Court for what was seen by law enforcement agents as unwarranted judicial activism, the Russian Parliament soon amended the article in line with the interpretation offered by the Court. This, however, did not end the controversy as critics raised a valid point: an automatic transfer of facts from civil proceedings with a priori more lenient requirements of proof is likely to distort outcomes, harming defendants, the prosecution, and, ultimately, societal interests. This article will turn for a potential solution to common law, which has been able to avoid this problem by clearly distinguishing between different standards of proof applicable in civil v. criminal litigations. It will be shown, using the United States as an example, how courts can effectively use issue preclusion to pursue a number of legitimate objectives, such as consistency of judgments and judicial economy, with due account for the interests of parties in proceedings. At the same time, issue preclusion appears an inappropriate and ineffective means to combat arbitrariness of the judiciary - the end which Russia’s Constitutional Court and law makers arguably had in mind when introducing the doctrine into Russian law. © 2015, Supporting Academic Initiatives Foundation.

The study is based on polls held among 21,320 school students in 365 schools of five regions of Russia (Moscow Oblast, Saint Petersburg, Leningrad Oblast, Tomsk, and Pskov). The most part of students speaking Russian as their second language attend schools of Moscow suburbs area (16%) with the least part attending schools of small towns and settlements of Leningrad Oblast (6.6%) and Pskov (8.5%). The sample covers 56 ethnic groups with some being rather small.

Among ethnic minorities, the highest numbers of locals are in Tomsk and Pskov (38-39%). In Saint Petersburg there are more locals or second generation migrants among Ukrainians, Belarusians and Tatars, whereas ""generation 1.5"" migrants prevail in number among Tadzhiks and Uzbeks (46-49%). Generation 1.5 migrants prevail among all ethnic groups in Moscow suburbs area with Uzbeks and Tadzhiks being the most prevailing (62%). In Tomsk, most of the ethnic minorities' representatives are either locals or second-generation migrants. Statistics on ethnic and migration status of school students allows for assessment not only of the scale of migration flows but also of a retrospective time dynamics for various ethnic groups. Families from Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia were actively moving to Russia 15-20 years ago. Now there is massive migration going on among Tadzhiks, Uzbeks and Kyrgyz who bring their children of various ages. We believe that education management authorities should initiate prudent integration of school students with Russian as their second language irrelevant of their citizenship but with consideration of their families' migration background.","Ethnic composition; Ethnicity; Migrant children; Migration generations; Migration status; Schools",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"English","Vopr.

The official document, which covers six areas, including 'Energy efficiency and energy saving', defines the key science and technology (SandT) areas Russia has to embark upon in order to boost its competitiveness.

The paper features major outcomes of the energy block and puts the exercise in a comparative perspective with similar international studies of Kazakhstan, Germany, Canada, the UK, USA and international organizations. The author concludes that in Russia energy efficiency and energy saving priorities dominate the policy agenda, with relatively little attention to advancing renewable energy technologies.

Building on the opposition between the logic of the gift and that of the market, we elucidate moral tensions that call debt relations into being. However, instead of reducing debt to either of these rival principles, we interpret it as a combination of both that allows for mediating between them in a highly ambiguous moral context. Using evidence from a small Russian town, we analyse how interest-free debt functions within face-to-face interactions in local shops and how it structures the ordinary lives of shopkeepers, salespeople and consumers in the community. We discuss a moral situation that turns the framing of everyday purchases into a problem and demonstrate how a material device – a debt book – enters into a transaction in order to resolve it. A debt book turns out to be a specific graphic technology, a destructive device that subverts both marketization and communitarian aid by suspending the framing of interaction. In the resulting atmosphere of ambiguity, debts become an object of strategic manipulation for the members of community that demands good negotiation skills and use of moral arguments. Although the constitution of debt economy is highly dependent on the dynamics of marketization and economization, it can in fact accommodate very different moral regimes. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","debt; framing; gift; market; moral economy; post-socialism",,,"Routledge",,,,,09502386,,,"English","Cult.

Their ability to provide regional leadership is hampered by the increasing complexities of the modern world, including the conflicting dynamics of regionalism itself.

Four basic patterns were singled out: ""authoritarian manager"", ""democratic manager"", ""authoritarian leader"" and ""democratic leader"". They were built together following the merge of two criteria: delegation regimes, i. e. steady patterns of interrelation between principals and other subjects and agents of management, as well as subjectivity of principals, i. e. their ability to independently determine and implement the organization's mission. Each pattern is described based on the example of FGOS (Federal State Educational Standard) introduction in elementary schools.

In contrast to other studies, we focus on the blogosphere as a political factor. Our conclusions are based on a study of the LiveJournal blogging platform represented by a sample of political posts from the top 2000 bloggers for 13-week-long periods. Sampling from the population of about 180,000 posts was performed automatically with a topic modelling algorithm, while the analysis of the resulting 3690 texts was carried out manually by five coders. We found that the most influential Russian blogs perform the role of a media ‘stronghold’ of the political opposition. Moreover, we established a relationship between the weekly pre-election ratings of the opposition parties and presidential candidates and the indicators of political activity in the blogosphere. Our results cautiously suggest that political activity on the Internet is not simply an online projection of offline political activity: it can itself provoke activity in offline political life. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Blogosphere; elections; LiveJournal; opposition; Russia; topic modelling",,,"SAGE Publications Ltd",,,,,14614448,,,"English","New Media and Society",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942944543

Social practices are classified according to types of alcoholic beverages consumed during the last 30 days, frequency of drinking, places of alcohol consumption, and association between alcohol drinking and mealtime. The research is built on the 21st wave of Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS-HSE), an annual nationwide panel survey designed to monitor health and economic welfare of households and individuals in Russia. All calculations were done on a sample of 8, 778 alcohol drinkers aged 15 and older. Methods used to analyze data embrace correspondence analysis, factor analysis, and k-means cluster analysis. Six practices of alcohol consumption are ascertained. Research findings demonstrate significant relation of social structure and alcohol consumption. Higher classes mostly represent consumers of light and expensive alcohol. Middle classes tend to consume homemade alcohol. Lower classes stick to vodka, traditional and cheap alcohol.

International relations is currently in a process of transformation, related to the dramatic increase in opportunities for transborder interaction among different communities and social groups. The result could be the creation of the new identity that exists beyond the states' borders. The wide practice of the transborder contacts increases the significance of values and ideology in international interaction. At the same time, the background for the transformation of international relations is the globalization that exacerbates the socioeconomic divide, the political divide and the value divide. As the result, there is an exponential increase in global political uncertainty and the international weakness of states. One effective remedy to systematize interactions and eliminate uncertainty is the establishment of complex institutional structures, which reflect the convictions and values of societies and communities in the course of history. Therefore, building appropriate institutes can significantly ease many existing international problems, including ones connected with the changing international environment. Another important thing is to provide mutual benefits for all involved actors. Otherwise, the established systems would not be significantly efficient. The decrease in the international capacities of the states also appears in the decrease of the hard power source to promote national interests. The significance of soft power is constantly rising. However, soft power does not involve direct action regarding the politics of other states. Smart power, which combines hard power for compulsion and vengeance and soft power for persuasion and attraction, is more effective and adequate. An actor's capacity to promote smart power is closely linked with contextual intellect and existing path dependence rooted in culture and historical experience, which shapes the collective cognition and perception of events and occurrences. Such factors directly influence the process of international institutionalization. In analyzing smart power aspects, this article draws attention to the concept of the ""three faces of power."" In addition, it points out the determinant meaning of security in international processes, which accounts for most important decisions of elites in the process of definization, the process of decision making regarding the national interests. Improving security can be treated as decreasing uncertainty, including by means of institutionalization and collective smart power implementation.","ASEAN; Asia-Pacific region; China; Culture; Definization; Hard power; Institutional changes; Securitization; Security; Smart power; Soft power; South-East Asia; Strategy; Uncertainty; United States",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,19967845,,,"English","Int.

To date, reasonable practical experience has been accumulated, but there is a lack of a comprehensive conceptual approach for using strategic foresight and roadmapping to solve management problems. Design/methodology/approach – This approach integrates corporate strategic foresight and roadmapping in several stages. During the foresight phase, the authors create scenarios of long-term development determined by long-term macro trends and challenges to identify “points of growth” and system of priorities for company growth. A strategic roadmap enables the company to form a “corridor” for specific projects and create a long-term action plan to implement the priorities identified in the first phase. Using a project roadmap makes it possible to ensure the implementation of a specific project, defining a system of goals, the necessary measures, their timing and financing, as well as indicators to assess their effectiveness. Findings – The core result of the suggested methodology is a set of possible trajectories of innovation development, reflecting the whole technological chain involving R&D – technology – product – market. Each path involves a sequence of organizational actions and key decision-making points that are necessary to be taken to introduce new technological solutions and develop innovation products with new features to the customer/user. These routes support decision-making in such fields as the choice of the product line, establishment of new partnerships with developers of innovation technologies, decisions regarding “insourcing-outsourcing” and the requirements for relevant scientific and technological breakthroughs. It allows corporations to create strategies for commercializing innovation products. Originality/value – The methodology proposes to integrate the results of foresight studies and in roadmaps and finally in business planning, adopting innovative strategies and management decisions. It contributes to the development of common principles and approaches to the subject, while taking account of company-specific features that can significantly affect the decision-making mechanism. The methodology is applicable to foreign and Russian companies when creating innovative strategies and management decisions based on the results of foresight. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate foresight; Innovation; Integrated roadmapping; Strategic foresight; Technology route",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,14636689,,,"English","Foresight",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939805112

The author identifies four ways of how separate images can be combined into an integrated ""text"", from the scenes characterized by an organic combination of individual images into a single narrative to the scenes which show neither organic interaction between individual images nor between the ""text"" and the shape of the object.

Internationally, its weakness was associated with the capital outflow from all emerging markets as a result of QE's tapering in the US. Domestically, rand plummeted because of the deterioration of the macroeconomic stance of South Africa itself: economic growth stalled and current account deficit widened again. Consumer spending was restrained with the high household indebtedness, investment climate worsened with the wave of bloody strikes, and net export was still prone to J-curve effect despite the degree of the devaluation happened. But, in its turn, those problems are a mere reflection of the deep institutional disbalances inherent to the very model of the national economy. Saving rate is too low in South Africa. This leads not only to an insufficient investment, but also to trade deficits and overdependence on speculative capital inflows. Extremely high unemployment means that the country's economic potential is substantially underutilized. Joblessness is generated, first and foremost, by the dualistic structure of the national entrepreneurship. Basic wages are being formed by way of a bargaining between big public and parastatal companies, on the one hand, and trade unions associated with the ruling party, on the other. Such a system is biased towards protection of vested interests of those who earn money in capital-intensive industries. At the same time, these rates of wages are prohibitively high for a small business; so far private companies tend to avoid job creation. A new impulse to economic development is likely to emerge only through the government's efforts to mitigate disproportions and to pursue an active industrial policy. National Development Plan adopted in 2012 is a practical step in that direction. But the growth of public investment is constrained by a necessity of fiscal austerity, since the budget deficit remained too large in recent years. South African Reserve Bank will have to choose between a stimulation of economic growth with low interest rates, on the one hand, and a support of rand by tightening of monetary policy, on the other. This dilemma will greatly influence prices of securities and yields at South African financial markets.","Current account deficit; Devaluation; Emerging markets; Gini coefficient; Industrial policy; Investment.; Saving; Social policy; South Africa; Unemployment",,,"Primakov National Research Institute",,,,,01312227,,,"Russian","World Economy Int.

It is caused by the fact that in such models profits are not used to increase the total annual supply, and the interest rate for the calculation of the TVM should reflect the effectiveness of cash flow of supply chain itself. A new formula considering the TVM for EOQ is found. The analytical assessment of the interest rate, which characterises the supply chain efficiency and is applied in calculations with the use of the generalised EOQ formula, is given.

However, a closer analysis shows that a high correlation is predicted mostly by the “Arab factor,” rather than by the precisely Islamic one, as a country’s belonging to the Arab world turns out to be a much stronger predictor of very low female labor participation rates than the percentage of Muslims in its population. These relationships hold even after controlling for other factors known to be related to female labor participation. This suggests that the anomalously low level of female labor participation observed in the Near and Middle East might be connected with certain elements of Arab culture that are not directly connected with Islam. © 2014 SAGE Publications.","Arab world; economic activity; female employment; gender; Islam; labor force; participation",,,"SAGE Publications Inc.",,,,,10693971,,,"English","Cross-Cult.

The commitment to university and profession is evaluated with a 3-component Meyer and Allen model that singles out: emotional commitment (emotional attachment to the university or profession), normative commitment (perceived liabilities towards the university or profession), commitment based on estimate of costs (subjective estimate of costs associated with potential change of the university or profession). It shows that there are no reasons for a conflict between commitment to the university and commitment to the profession, however different groups of teachers feature different correlation between those sets. What is the most important in differentiating between the commitments is the role of work experience in a different university. Publication activity of teachers is not related to their emotional commitment to the profession or the university, however it is related to cost estimate and the normative commitment to the university and the profession. Based on which the author concludes that Russian teachers are not encouraged with article publications, i. e. with the research activity in general as the attractive part of their job and most likely are forced to do it.","Academic inbreeding; Commitment to organization; Commitment to profession; Satisfaction with job; Teaching staff; Universities",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"English","Vopr.

It is argued that the rise of political nationalism since the late 1980s can be explained by the development of cultural nationalism in the previous decades, as an unintended outcome of Communist nationalities policy. All ethnic regions are examined throughout the entire history of the USSR (49 regions, 1917–1991), using the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. This paper aims to make at least three contributions to the field. First, it is a methodological contribution for studying nationalism: a “quantification of history” approach. Having constructed variables from historical data, I use conventional statistical methods such as SEM. Second, this paper contributes to the theoretical debate about the role of cultural autonomy in multiethnic states. Finally, the paper statistically proves that the break between early Soviet and Stalinist nationalities policy explains the entire Soviet nationalities policy. © 2015 Association for the Study of Nationalities.","culture; ethnicity; nationalism; SEM; USSR","comparative study; culture; ethnicity; historical perspective; nationalism; numerical model; USSR",,"Routledge",,,,,00905992,,,"English","Natl.

The best examples of such imagined gifts were those values and privileges that the Popes allegedly received from Constantine the Great after his conversion to Christianity. The fictitious generosity of Constantine was invented in 'his' famous detailed charter forged in the 8th or 9th century. But other imagined gifts, also having strong legitimizing effect, used to come into being in the same way, due to equally elaborated narratives. As the principality of Moscow was striving for regional dominance in the 15th and 16th cenfuries, a series of influential texts was composed, describing and explaining the gifts of extraordinary political and symbolic relevance, allegedly made either to ancestors of the ruling dynasty, or to predecessors of the highest church dignitaries. The most known among those writings are the anonymous Tale of the Novgorodian White Cowl and the Tale of the princes of Vladimir, as well as the Epistle on the Monomachos Crown by Spiridon-Sawa. These texts claimed that the secular potentates of Moscow, as well as ecclesiastical heads of Novgorod, had been presented in the past with invaluable insignia, either symbolizing the succession to the Roman emperors, or testifying the special benevolence of God. As the author finally argues, the morphology of these imagined gifts was mainly the same as of those in the Donation of Constantine: no really new regalia were created, but the ones already existing were vested with quite new, and nobler, significance, able to ensure a higher level of legitimacy for their possessors. Therefore the ways, how such imagined gifts used to be invented, seem to be substantially identical throughout Europe. © Franz Steiner Verlag GmbH, Stuttgart/Gertnany.",,,,"Franz Steiner Verlag Wiesbaden GmbH",,,,,00214019,,,"German","Jahrb.

When thinking about the early modern subject as an actor's category, we must distinguish three different meanings: the subject as a bearer of properties, as a reference point for predication, and as the foundation of a discipline. The paper defends the thesis that crucial elements of subjectivity in the modern sense, namely reflexivity and selfawareness, are at the same time characteristic features of a certain understanding of the subject of philosophy as a discipline in the early modern sense: namely for conceptions of philosophy as a transformation of the soul, most notably as a 'medicine of the soul'. Such conceptions are, however, controversial: other early modern thinkers contend that such proposals do not conform to what we should expect from a definition of philosophy and that they are open to the objection of intellectualism: we need more than knowledge to better our souls, because knowledge in itself is not action-guiding. The paper traces conceptions of the subject of philosophy not only in various Ramist tracts, but also in writings of Melanchthon's son-inlaw Heinrich Paxmann, the Helmstedt professor Duncan Liddell, and Reformed thinkers like Fortunatus Crell and Bartholomaeus Keckermann.","Bartholomaeus keckermann; Duncan liddell; Early modern; Fortunatus crell; Germany; Heinrich paxmann; Meta-philosophy; Ramism",,,"Universitatea de Vest Vasile Goldis din Arad",,,,,18431348,,,"English","Soc.

Access to higher education can be limited at different levels: personal (lack of competencies required to enter a specific university), family (social and cultural status of parents), or institutional (the schooling system). Being affected by these factors, a candidate might only qualify for a non-selective university offering curricula of lower quality. This paper uses the data provided by the Monitoring of Education Markets and Organizations and by the ranking assessing the quality of admission to higher education institutions to evaluate the factors affecting the choice of university based on the level of its selectivity. It appears that opting for a selective higher education institution not only depends on the USE (Unified State Exam) points obtained by the candidate (the major criterion of admission in the Russian Federation) but is also determined by the factors that are not directly associated with the candidate's skills: father's education, financial standing of the family, its cultural capital, school characteristics (type of school, specialization in the class), and the amount of financial investments in test preparation courses. All together, these factors challenge the equality of opportunities for candidates and the accessibility of quality higher education for students from low-income families.","Accessibility of higher education; Cultural capital; Educational strategies of candidates; Investments in test preparation; Non-selective universities; Selective universities; The Unified State Exam (USE)",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"English","Vopr.

Methodology/approach - The chapter provides a summary of the existing literature on corporate parenting styles and uncovers the missing elements in the theoretical constructs. New theoretical constructs fill the gaps. Findings - The chapter presents a new typology of corporate parenting style by combining corporate parents' processes of adding value to and extracting value from subsidiaries. The five-type typology of corporate styles outlines the different levels of value addition and value extraction and various degrees of reciprocity in both processes. This chapter determines the most important factors that affect the selection of corporate parenting style. It postulates that the multinational corporation should exhibit different parenting styles toward its subsidiaries simultaneously and should be ready to amend its parenting styles to reflect changes in a subsidiary's strategy and its motives for corporate ownership. Research limitations/implications - A new agenda for empirical studies oriented toward variability of parenting styles is proposed. Empirical tests of our propositions are needed. I encourage researchers to extend our research by considering the regional (supra-national), industry, and individual levels of analyses. Originality/value - The chapter provides a more realistic view of corporate parenting styles than that found in the previous literature and outlines promising directions for further theoretical and empirical research.

The focus is on the ""rhythmic freedom"" of verse as well as on the linguistic and historical determinants of that freedom. Special attention is devoted to omissions of metrical stress and the development of differences in the rhythmic profile of the English, Dutch, German, and Russian iamb. The study investigates the link between the average number of syllables in the rhythmic words of each language and the degree of strictness in the realization of metrical structure. The results we have obtained give grounds for considering that the length of words is not-as scholars have previously thought-the decisive factor in allowing verse to free itself from its metrical bounds. A comparative analysis of identical types of versification in different languages allows us to view this issue quite differently. It frequently turns out that not the linguistic but the historical conditions of creating of the new versification have the decisive influence on the nature of the interaction between meter and language.

The case under investigation here is the Russian Naval Ministry's ""literary expedition"", launched by Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaevič in 1855-1861 to study the fishing and shipping practices of different parts of the Russian Empire and to produce sketches about them. Exploring the preparatory stage of the expedition, the author identifies the European and Russian precedents of literary ethnography from Adelbert Chamisso's Reise um die Welt to Ivan Gončarov's Frigate Pallas, which may have provided a model for Konstantin. Extant unpublished documents of the expedition from Russian and Estonian archives allow us to reconstruct its ideological origins and to show that it was born from the spirit of the Russian Geographical Society's projects and the so-called ""nationalizing"" paradigm of ethnographic knowledge that dominated the discursive field in the 1850s. The author demonstrates that the underlying idea of the expedition had much in common with Slavophile ethnography (the case of Ivan Aksakov) and its project of ""Russian science"". The last part of the article shows how this ""nationalizing"" paradigm clashed with cosmopolitan and liberal ideas when Konstantin was launching the expedition. © 2015 © 2015 The Association of Scandinavian Slavists and Baltologists.","History of Russian science; literary ethnography; mid-nineteenth century Russian literature; Russian nationalism; writers and power",,,"Routledge",,,,,00806765,,,"English","Scando-Slavica",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84934779516

Features of political communication in Russian-speaking segment of the Facebook network are analyzed in the article. According to researchers unlike their counterparts in the U.S. and elsewhere, Russian bloggers prefer platforms that combine features typical of blogs with features of social network services like Facebook. The data were collected into a complicated political period (violent events in Ukraine), which is considerably stimulated the activity of the Russian opposition and manipulative processes in the Russian social networks. Objectives. The objectives were: classification of actors in the political groups in the Russian-speaking segment of Facebook and analysis of their sociolinguistic behavior. Method. The interdisciplinary analysis based on scope of politically active groups (N 200) and actors (N 291) during January - May, 2014. Results. Actors were classified by politic opinions into mainstream, oppositional and nationalist Clusters and based on network activity into designers of communication space, manipulators, graphomaniacs and local cluster authors. Their communicative and speech behavior was also analyzed and shown shaped specific virtual identities, which demonstrate distinguished sociolinguistic behavior. Discussion and Conclusion. Today the analysis of communication processes in politically active communities in the network environment is of great importance as the virtual sphere becomes more and more significant for achieve of various political aims both in Russia and around the world. The prospect of an actual study is to identify the ratio of online and off-line communication activity of actors in the political sphere in the Russian segment of Facebook. © 2015, University of La Laguna.

Full-text articles from “The Economist”, published between 2008 and 2014, were selected to analyze the semantics of words and word combinations that imply a Russian business reality. All units were classified according to topic-relation and language sources of stereotypes. The findings showed that the topic-related stereotypes focus on representation of people in three areas – government, business, and realia. As for the linguistic perspective, figurative means are the basic sources for stereotypes, with the emphasis on similes and metaphors of people. Reference sources for figurative means and morphologic means are business-related. Though negative linguistic stereotypes prevail, there are rare positive stereotypes, expressed through syntax. Thus, linguistic stereotypical means help to create the image of Russian business in simplified categories and underlined contrasts: stereotypical lexical units of well-being are combined with characteristics of a poorly-kept country. The intercultural implication of the study is the necessity of enhanced awareness of stereotyping potential of media language. © 2014 Immigrant Institutet.

In Russia cohabitation has risen sharply in the last decades, but recently its level has stabilized and even decreased slightly. OBJECTIVE We intend to highlight gender and educational differences in perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages of cohabitation vs. marriage. METHODS We conducted 8 focus groups in Moscow in January 2012 (4 with men, 4 with women, half with higher educated participants and half with lower educated participants). RESULTS Participants claimed that trust between men and women underlies preferences for marriage or cohabitation. Participants? religious beliefs form a 'three stages of union' theory: cohabitation in the beginning, civil marriage later when trust has developed, and finally a church wedding when trust is established. In union formation the participants? ideals are the values of responsibility, freedom, fidelity, and trust. The level of trust is highest for proponents of marriage and ideational cohabitors. People without a strong preference for a certain type of union have the lowest level of interpersonal trust. CONCLUSIONS In a society that currently can be considered anomic, interpersonal trust was found to be the most important factor underlying expressed ideals in choice of union type. It takes different forms for adherents of marriage (""trust with closed eyes"") and adherents of cohabitation (""trust with open eyes""). © 2015 Olga Isupova.",,,,"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research",,,,,14359871,,,"English","Demogr.

I analyze the historical development of verbs which are currently labile in modern Russian. The main group of Russian labile verbs includes verbs of motion. On the basis of corpus and dictionary data, I conclude that the behavior of the lexemes under analysis is far from being uniform. However, interestingly, for most of them, e.g., lit' 'flow/pour', gonjat' 'run, drive/chase, pursue', and kružit' 'go round, turn, roll', the proportion of the intransitive use grows throughout the period under analysis, though for the verb kapat'/kapnut' 'drop, pour in drips', in contrast, the transitive use becomes more and more frequent. In the cases when the intransitive use becomes more frequent, the semantic change matches the statistical one. In the beginning, verbs of this subtype were only used intransitively in a restricted type of contexts (e.g., for gonjat' 'run, drive/chase, pursue', hunting contexts represent this restricted class), where the intransitive use might be a result of object omission. Later on, the semantic range of the intransitive use became wider and the lability was no longer semantically related to object omission. I conclude that the emergence of an intransitive use of a strictly transitive verb or the increase of the number of intransitive uses is often accompanied by semantic changes: first, a verb is used intransitively in a very restricted range of contexts (for the verb gonjat' these include hunting contexts). Then, the range of contexts and the semantics of the intransitive use becomes wider, the number of intransitive uses grows and the verb becomes canonically labile with both uses being equally or almost equally frequent. Importantly, the borderline between A- and P-lability is not as strict as it is put sometimes: P-lability (the causative/non-causative alternation) can in some cases be traced back to A-lability (object omission). © 2015 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.","argument; causation; labile verbs; motion verbs; the Russian language; transitivity",,,"Walter de Gruyter GmbH",,,,,00243949,,,"English","Linguistics",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928942803

This can be done several times in one route. In our heuristic every route is constructed by sequentially inserting customers to it in the way similar to Solomon’s (1987) approach developed for simple vehicle routes. Our contributions include: heuristic insertion procedure for complex truck and trailer routes with transshipment locations; efficient randomized mechanisms for choosing the first customer for insertion, for making time window violations, and for making split-deliveries; an improvement procedure shifting deliveries in a route to earlier time; an efficient approach dealing with site-dependency feature based on the transportation problem in case of arbitrary intersecting vehicle sets and a fast vehicle assignment procedure in case of nested vehicle sets. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Insertion heuristic; Site-dependent; Soft time windows; Split-deliveries; Truck and trailer","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Learning systems; Optimization; Sales; Transportation routes; Truck trailers; Trucks; Unloading; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Insertion heuristic; Randomized mechanism; Site-dependent; Soft time windows; Split delivery; Transportation problem; Truck and trailer routing problems; Vehicle assignment; Truck transportation","","Springer Verlag","1st International Workshop on Machine Learning, Optimization, and Big Data, MOD 2015","21 July 2015 through 23 July 2015",,160669,03029743,9783319279251,,"English","Lect.

Hundreds of thousands of Russians across the country started to participate in election observation beginning from federal elections, 2011-2012. In this context, tree main questions are relevant. How has this movement emerged and developed? What is the qualitative composition of its participants? How socially significat is the movement in terms of its impact on the development of civil society and democracy? Mixed method research was used: qualitative research (7 in-depth interviews), and a quantitative survey (N=1506) conducted online. Results of the study show that despite the fact that people's participation in election observation was massive, this activity was not chaotic. Process of involving citizens in election observation was based on well-built system, coordinated by new organizations. They distribute videos aimed at attracting citizens to become election observers; train in election legislation; develop and distribute manuals, handbooks and ""road maps""; organize ""mobile groups"", hot lines, and parallel vote tabulation. Qualitative composition of domestic election observers feature educated people under 45 with relatively high level of material welfare, not members or supporters of parliamentary parties. Moreover, election observers are actively involved in NGOs as well as in volunteering and donations. Activities of domestic election observers in Russia for the last two years enhance development of civic skills and increase levels of legal awareness thus contributing to empowering Russian civil society and democracy.","Civil society; Election observers; Movement of election observers",,,"Russian Academy of Sciences",,,,,01321625,,,"Russian","Sotsiologicheskie Issled.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975744712

Currencies of countries with high inflation and real interest rates and negative net foreign asset position (debtor countries) are more exposed to the downside risk whereas currencies of countries with low inflation and real interest rates and positive net foreign asset position (creditor countries) exhibit ""safe haven"" properties. The local real interest rate has the highest explanatory power in accounting for the cross-section of currency exposure to the downside risk.

If the greedy walk has an ability to find the nearest neighbor in the graph starting from any vertex with a small number of steps, such a graph is called a navigable small world. In this paper we propose a new algorithm for building graphs with navigable small world properties. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it is free from input parameters and has an ability to adapt on the fly to any changes in the distribution of data.

Due to historical reasons, the differences between eastern and western regions of Germany persist over time. We explore the differences in the determinants of the regional unemployment as well as the differences in spatial effects by estimating spatial models. We use panel data for 407 out of 413 German regions (using the NUTS III regional structure) for 2001 through 2009. In order to account for possible spatial interactions between regions, we use a spatial weighting matrix of inverse distances. We estimate static and dynamic models by the maximum likelihood estimation approach, developed by Anselin (Spatial econometrics: Methods and models, Berlin: Springer, 1988) specifically for spatial models and elaborated by Lee and Yu (Journal of Econometrics, 154, 165–185, 2010a; Regional Science and Urban Economics, 40, 255–271, 2010b).

We determine that during the entire period, earnings inequality was substantially higher in the informal sector. Informality increases earnings polarization, widening both tails of the earnings distribution. Nonetheless, inequality has declined in both formal and informal sectors. In the formal sector, changes in the distribution of monthly earnings between 2000 and 2010 were primarily generated by changes in the distribution of hourly earnings. In the informal sector, reduction of variation in monthly earnings went through two channels: declining differences in hourly rates and considerable compositional shifts within the informal sector. The results point to the importance of distributional analysis of earnings gaps and explicit accounting for the sector choice. © 2015 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Decomposition; Earnings inequality; Informal economy; Recentred influence functions","decomposition analysis; employment; income distribution; informal sector; wage; Russian Federation",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",,,,,09670750,,,"English","Econ.

It introduces original data illustrating the declining mortality rate from CVD, and the diminishing contribution of these diseases to overall mortality rate - globally and, to a larger extent, in developed countries. The paper also analyses the reasons for continuing CVD epidemic in Russia. Based on factual evidence, it argues that those include insufficient expenditures on treating CVD patients, and critically inadequate funding of prevention programmes. Unsatisfactory use of these funds to subsidise Russian regions (without taking into account their actual needs determined by the CVD mortality rate) only makes the problem worse. Through modelling, «average» efficiency of the Russian health care system in reducing CVD mortality was revealed. The paper describes various scenarios for future development of the Russian CVD situation. In the context of innovation-based scenario, the advantages of technological foresight are analysed; specifically, the authors summarise major S&T development trends in the health sector (using data of the Russian S&T Foresight 2030), which could significantly contribute to stopping the CVD epidemic in Russia.","Cardiovascular diseases; Funding; Government; Priorities; Technological foresight",,,"Izdatel'stvo Meditsina",,,,,08696047,,,"Russian","Vestn.

Dynamic network analysis answers the question, how specific forms of student behavior, like bad habits, develop and propagate. It is also helpful in following how school or university students enter into friendship or antagonism with each other, as well as in assessing the impact social relations have on academic performance. The paper gives a review of the two key methods used for empirical analysis of social network dynamics. Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOM) represent one of the most elaborated techniques of social network dynamics investigation. This approach regards the present state of a network as dependable on its preceding state uniquely. Network evolution appears to be continuous, not discrete, so that a structural macro change is, in fact, a multitude of micro changes. Instead of dealing with structure of the network and prerequisites for its development, the SAOM model studies the processes underlying any changes recorded. Separable Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models (STERGM) are an alternative approach towards research on social network dynamics. In this case, the social network observed is a materialization of one of possible networks with predetermined characteristics. Any network develops in the result of a stochastic process, and the research should be aimed at discovering what forces this process is driven by. Comparison of an empirically discovered network with networks of similar size reveals structural features of the network and characteristics of actors who influenced the process of its establishment. In this paper, we also give an example of how both models can be used with the same set of data.","Academic performance; Deviant behavior; Separable Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models; Social networks; Statistical-dynamical models; Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Having surveyed nine-graders in Saint Petersburg and in one of the districts in Leningrad region, we analyze the motives for choosing the ""through college to university"" educational trajectory and the ideas students with their parents had about benefits, costs, and risks of this pathway. It appears that geographical location plays a key role in choosing this trajectory. Opting for an alternative educational pathway is less typical of rural students dealing with much more structural constrains than their urban counterparts.

Harsh confrontation with the West, isolationism within the country, militarization and increased government control of the economy, public and private space, as well as a crackdown on any independently-minded civic forces are all factors that have been rapidly obliterating gains made in the quarter of a century after the collapse of the communist regime.

Despite the abundance of resources for language learning, there is often a lack of specific exercises targeting a particular group of learners or ESP course. This paper gives an overview of a computer system called Exercise Maker that is aimed at flexible and versatile language exercise generation. The system supports seven exercise types, which can be generated from arbitrary passages written in English. Being able to tailor educational material to learners' interests is known to boost motivation in learners (Heilman et al., 2010). An important feature of the system is the automatic ranking of the source passages according to their complexity/readability. As shown by expert evaluation, the automatically generated exercises are of high quality: The gap precision is about 97-98%, while the overall exercise acceptance rate varies from 90% to 97.5%.

It acts as a core cooperation mechanism for the Arctic states, which allows them to coordinate their efforts across a number of issue areas. Such cooperation between state and non-state actors is needed because of harsh climate conditions, a high degree of inaccessibility, underdeveloped infrastructure and difficult overall economic situation, aggravated by problems specific to indigenous communities. The article analyzes the history, evolution and transformation of the Arctic Council, tracing the progress of its institutionalization to determine its effectiveness in addressing the most pressing regional issues, such as climate change, economic development, waterways security and safety, as well as the delimitation of the Arctic Ocean. Drawing on national documents and official statements, the article also provides information on the official positions of the ""Arctic Five"" countries (Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the United States) on their involvement in the Arctic Council as well as their views on the future of such collaboration and the forum's potential institutionalization. The institutionalization trend has pervaded the Arctic Council's agenda since the first ministers' meeting in 1996. Despite several members' reluctance to see the council as a new universal international organization responsible for dealing with the full spectrum of Arctic issues, this goal was a principle motivation behind the transformation of the 1991 Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy into the full-fledged international forum. The principal limitations of the Arctic Council lie outside of the institution's agenda and scope. Geopolitical differences and conflicts that do not directly relate to the Arctic region, such as the conflict in Ukraine, can potentially disrupt the council's activities. However, despite these difficulties, the forum's concrete and depoliticized agenda facilitates cooperation among the states, which continue to engage on non-political, yet nonetheless prominent, Arctic issues.","Arctic; Arctic council; International cooperation; Regional governance",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,19967845,,,"English","Int.

This new language allowed people to communicate with authorities and to achieve their specific goals through playing with official notions and terms. The soviet approach was specific not just in that education was brought together with solving ideological and upbringing problems but in that it was a totally deliberate and transparent process. Eradication of illiteracy in the Soviet Union was accompanied by radical changes to the way people lived and worked, which resulted in immediate demand for and utilization of the skills they acquired. That was the key to success of the Soviet illiteracy eradication campaign. None of the countries that used the Soviet scheme in their enlightenment projects cold replicate this success, as people were taught literacy with the traditional social relationships being preserved. As a result, knowledge was distributed much slower and population often lost their newly-acquired skills quickly.","ABC books; Cultural revolution; Eradication of illiteracy; History of education; Ideology; Peasantry; «lingua Sovietica»",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Unlike Mosfilm and Lenfilm, united in Alma-Ata (Almaty), Kazakhstan, Soiuzdetfilm went to Stalinabad (Dushanbe), Tajikistan from late 1941 to 1943. Separated from the filmmaking world, Soiuzdetfilm experienced evacuation as a period of rancorous disputes and all too few achievements.

This problem is relevant today because each diversified corporate structure (the diversified company) is a unique phenomenon. Therefore for the diversified companies, developing by the M&A strategy, the question about value creation or destruction and the market perception of their corporate conception demand to be studied in the framework of the individual approach. This study deals with an analysis of the M&A strategy utilized by Unilever Group, as well as with issues relating to identifying the factors defining the value of a diversified company. To these ends, there are particular methods that can be applied to Unilever Group. Because the structure of this diversified company is rather complex, it makes sense to determine whether the company has been accurately valued by the market (if it is overvalued/undervalued), as well as to define the way the market responds to M&A transactions effected by this company. This study includes an estimation of the effectiveness of Unilever Group's mergers and acquisitions strategy, aimed at creating the optimum business portfolio within the diversified corporate structure (company) by how it affects value of the company. The general hypothesis assumes that diversification does not have a destructive effect on the value of an international multi-business company that builds its portfolio based on the success of certain brands and business areas. © Medwell Journals, 2015.","Company value; Diversified company; Expected rate of return on invested capital; Merger and acquisition transactions; Strategy effectiveness",,,"Medwell Journals",,,,,19935250,,,"English","Int.

Official governmental reports regarding the implementation of the national project “Health” focus only on the material component of the reform process, namely the quantity of purchased equipment and the amount of funding spent. Until now, there has been little assessment of the sociopolitical processes involved in reforming the health care system and little understanding of whether the socioeconomic status and prestige of the medical profession have improved. This chapter seeks to fill that gap. The empirical data reported in this chapter is based on national statistics on health care reform (1995–2011) and several mass surveys of Russian physicians and the population, namely the Russian longitude monitoring survey (RLMS-HSE, HSE, 2005–2011, N = 12641), and “The prestige of the medical profession in Russian society” (Moscow, St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, HSE, 2011, N = 120). The results show that the rhetoric of neoliberal reforms in the Russian system of public health care includes the professional group of doctors as a social institute in the regulation processes.

Using the NOBUS micro-data and a methodology based on the estimation of the wage equation augmented by aggregate regional characteristics, we show that wage differentials across Russian regions have a compensative nature. Russian workers receive wage compensations for living in regions with a higher price level and worse nonpecuniary characteristics, such as a relatively low life expectancy, a high level of air pollution, poor medical services, a colder climate, and a higher unemployment level. These compensations are not associated with the existing government system of compensating wage coefficients. After adjusting for regional amenities and disamenities, regionalwages become positively correlated with interregionalmigration flows. According to our estimates, wage compensations along with differences in employment composition are able to account for about three-fourths of the observed variation in wages across Russian regions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015","Compensating differentials; Migration; Regional wages; Russia",,,"Springer Verlag",,,,,1863916X,,,"English","AIEL Ser.

In this paper we present a method of disambiguation without gold standard corpora using several statistical models, namely, Brill algorithm (Brill 1995) and unambiguous n-grams from the automatically annotated corpus. All the methods were tested on the Corpus of Modern Greek and on the Corpus of Modern Yiddish. As a result, more than a half of words with ambiguous analyses were disambiguated in both corpora, demonstrating high precision (>80%).

The Critical Thinking Analytic Rubric was used for both pre and post-course metacognitive competencies assessments while argumentation skills were assessed with the help of a new developed rubric. The results showed various patterns of positive change in all the categories and seem to support the hypothesis that this approach to writing-to-learn in L1 and L2 leads to successful acquisition of disciplinary knowledge and skills.","Argumentation skills; Critical thinking; Historical reasoning; L1/l2 instruction; Writing-to-learn",,,"University of Antwerp",,,,,20301006,,,"English","J.

The Hobbesian outlook would be that people violate the law in the absence of appropriate punishment. John Stuart Mill would have attributed the violation to the lack of incentives to behave legally. In this paper, we combine these two factors to examine the effect of antitrust regulation on price competition. We examine the case of public drug procurement in St. Petersburg, Russia between 2008 and 2010. Our results highlight that the Russian Federal Antitrust Service was unable to enforce competitive bidding when the main regulators interpreted the competition law differently. The Committee for Public Health in St. Petersburg notably leveraged the loopholes in antitrust enforcement and successfully maintained illegal relationships with different economic agents. We use data on Russian drug procurement to illustrate these effects. Based on our estimates, we suggest policy implications regarding antitrust policy. © The Author 2015.",,,,"Oxford University Press",,,,,17446414,,,"English","J. Compet.

Previous findings suggested that in agriculture, the barriers for technology adaption are particularly high due to technological conservatism and the atomic structure of the industry. Although RTOs in agriculture publish more and register more patents, they struggle to translate their success into transfer activities. While technology transfer in mining goes well hand in hand with applied research, RTOs in agriculture either build on new technologies or generate revenues through ready-to-use services. The explanation for this rather short-term oriented demand for services of Russia's RTOs lies in the financial situation of client organisations. The vast majority complain about their dire lack of financial means to pay for new technologies. Consequently, agricultural producers do not generate enough revenues to pursue future opportunities, with far reaching consequences. The situation could get better if the RTOs and the client would agree to longer-lasting relationships. © 2015 Imperial College Press.","agriculture; mining; Russia; Technology transfer",,,"World Scientific Publishing Co.

Discussions presented focus on recent technological developments and their impacts on society with three plausible future scenarios; the energy agenda with new technological advancements and future energy partnerships; and the dynamics of Russia’s future development agenda amid the Ukraine crisis. Design/methodology/approach - The paper includes a commentary on the SPIEF 2014 Forum. Ideas presented are extended through the review of relevant references and future scenarios. Findings - Technological development will continue to shape societies and may even result with the transformation of social classes. Energy will remain as a top priority area on the global and regional socio-economic agenda, with political implications across the world and in Russia. Research limitations/implications - A number of research questions arose through the discussion on the relationships between science, technology and society; future energy technologies; and geo-politics. Social implications - Technological development will certainly have implications on society. The paper explores those impacts through “visionary”, “negative” and “different” scenarios. Similarly, the transformations in the energy sector will have broader social and environmental impacts. Originality/value - With the original ideas presented, this viewpoint paper addresses some of the grand social, technological, economic, environmental and political challenges that societies face today.

In the first case we solve an absence problem of aprioristic information on objects’ possible class association and avoid inclusion of noise objects in the training and test sets, that will provide development of more exact SVM classifier. In the second case we use part of the clustering results received by means of the fuzzy clustering algorithms’ ensemble for training of SVM classifier, and another-for the specification of the clustering results by means of the trained SVM classifier.

This is mainly due to increasing awareness among politicians, academics and the wider population on the importance of environmental aspects in daily life. Consequently demand for environmentally friendly solutions is expected to grow continuously in the next decade. The present study is part of a broader research project which examines the long-term science and technology (S&T) agenda in Russia up to 2030. The project's results were approved by the Prime Minister of Russia in early January 2014. Researchers from the National Research University Higher School of Economics carried out the research project at the request of the Russian Ministry of Education and Science between 2011 and 2013. The research comprised six interrelated spheres: ICT; biotechnology, medicine and public health; new materials and nanotechnologies; environmental management; transport and space systems; and energy efficiency and energy conservation. For each sphere, the project explored in-depth the global emergent challenges and opportunities, the risks, and their degree of influence on Russia. The authors analysed the most important potential market niches, products and services that are capable of radically shaping world markets and highlighted their competitive advantages. Within the framework of these priority science areas authors emphasised several spheres of particular potential value and compared the level of research carried out in Russia and the leading countries. The current paper also covers the analyses of the natural resources sector made within a project aimed at integration of national and sectoral S&T Foresight studies funded by the Russian Ministry of Education and Science. Findings show that the potential applications for environmental products and services are manifold. The study is based on a thorough analysis of expert opinions and their assessment of future applications and the development of demand for these applications. However the authors note that the expert opinions included in the assessment of prospective products, services and markets, despite being based on rigorous assessment, still reflect expectations. Their opinions incorporate a degree of uncertainty especially with regard to how and when (or whether) the markets, technologies, products and services will develop in the expected ways.

What role do these appliances play in shaping sustainable behavior on the part of the consumer? Scientists in this field believe that household devices have certain scenarios of use, which they refer to as ""scripts."" Is change in the scripts associated with such devices the key to more sustainable consumption? This case study examined how consumers interpret and respond to the scripts of the devices they use in their everyday lives. Pro-environmentalist consumers were compared with those who have little concern about environmental problems. In-depth interviews found that the scripts embedded in domestic appliances were seen by the two groups in different ways, and the groups varied in how much influence the scripts had on consumer behavior. Consumers with few environmental concerns were found to be more likely to change to more pro-environmental behavior patterns following the technological scripts. The study also considered the generalizability of these results and their broader implications for practical action. © 2015 by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"consumption behavior; environmental management; household survey; perception; sustainability; technology adoption; Moscow [Russian Federation]; Russian Federation",,"Mary Ann Liebert Inc.",,,,,19370695,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84934768197

Now we engage the global Richardson extrapolation in time to derive the high order method both with respect to space and time steps. To study its properties, we comment on its stability and give results of numerical experiments and enlarged practical error analysis for three typical examples. Unlike most common second order (in either space or time step) methods, the proposed method is able to provide high precision results in the uniform norm by using adequate computational costs. It works even in the case of discontinuous potentials and non-smooth solutions far beyond the scope of its standard theory.

Given an unlabeled tree τ on n nodes and suffix links of its internal nodes, we ask the question “Is τ a suffix tree?”, i.e., is there a string S whose suffix tree has the same topological structure as τ? We place no restrictions on S, in particular we do not require that S ends with a unique symbol. This corresponds to considering the more general definition of implicit or extended suffix trees. Such general suffix trees have many applications and are for example needed to allow efficient updates when suffix trees are built online. We prove that τ is a suffix tree if and only if it is realized by a string S of length n − 1, and we give a linear-time algorithm for inferring S when the first letter on each edge is known.

This study investigates European gas market transformations and how the Russian gas export strategy is adapting to these changes. Analyses of contract renegotiations and reported prices show that although Gazprom still formally follows the traditional oil indexation rhetoric, it has in fact already significantly reviewed its pricing policy. However, the further development of Russia's position in the European gas market is still unclear. The basic question is whether Russia will go for spot pricing or will it still provide all price reviews within the framework of oil indexation? Analyses of the European gas market supply-demand balance show that pricing policy changes could be expected by the end of this decade, when new suppliers reach the European market and the next wave of gas glut might occur. Until then Russia will most likely follow its current strategy of delaying providing the minimum discount acceptable to the buyer for as long as possible.","Economics & finance; Energy; Fossil fuels","Commerce; Costs; Economics; Fossil fuels; Oil shale; Contract renegotiations; Energy; European gas markets; European markets; Most likely; Price review; Pricing policy; Spot pricing; Gases",,"Thomas Telford Services Ltd",,,,,17514223,,,"English","Proc.

The blow-forming tests were carried out at the temperature of 415 °C using aluminum alloy (AMg-6) sheets of a 0.92 mm thickness. Each test was performed at constant pressure. For each fixed value of pressure, a series of experiments was carried out with different forming times to obtain evolutions of dome height H and thickness s. Two different constitutive equations were used to describe the dependence of flow stress on the effective strain rate: the Backofen power equation and the Smirnov one taking into account an s-shape of stress-strain rate curve in the logarithmic scale. The constants of these equations were obtained by least squares minimization of deviations between the experimental variations of H and s and ones predicted by a simplified engineering model formulated for this purpose. Using the Smirnov constitutive model to describe the dependence of flow stress on strain rate, unlike the classical power law, makes it possible to analyze the variation of strain rate sensitivity index m with strain rate. On the basis of the obtained data, the optimum strain rate for AMg-6 processing was estimated as one corresponding to the maximum of strain rate sensitivity index. The validity of the proposed method was examined by finite element simulation of free bulging process. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The absence of significant growth benefits to resource-endowed regions is at odds with the beneficial impact of natural resources, and particularly hydrocarbons, on the growth of the country as a whole.

In contrast to most of the previous literature, we do not analyze the effect of migration on language; the surveyed children were usually born in Chuvashia, Russia.

For the objective assessment of this phenomenon it is necessary to have a clear understanding of how this level changes over time, which processes at the labour market and in society facilitate the increase or decrease of gender asymmetry in the distribution of employees between economic activities and occupations and which economic consequences are caused by segregation. The questions raised are studied in the paper in terms of the dynamics of employed by the economic activities, which on the one hand reflects the desire of workers to be employed in certain activities and, on the other hand, characterizes the real employment opportunities. In order to identify the gender peculiarities of the changes in the regional employment structure, the authors suggested the methodology, based on the qualitative and quantitative approach to the assessment of the dynamics of the number of employed. The use of the index of dissimilarity allowed defining the share of employers of the same gender, which should have changed the sphere of activity provided that the employees of the other gender remain at their jobs, in order to achieve the equal distribution of men and women by economic activities. The obtained data confirm the necessity to implement the measures for the reduction of the gender segregation in the employment structure of the regional employment. © MCSER-Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.","Gender employment structure by economic activities; Gender segregation; Index of dissimilarity; Labour market; Region",,,"Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research",,,,,20399340,,,"English","Mediterranean J.

The programme aims to address taboos, stigma, discrimination, HIV/AIDS prevention and the promotion of sexual reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and a healthy lifestyle among adolescents. The programme uses an “edutainment” model that involves young people through music, dance and youth icons. Educated volunteers provide schoolchildren with comprehensive information on SRHR and demonstrate the practical application of life and leadership skills. The programme ends with a celebration event.Design/methodology/approach – Qualitative and quantitative methods were used. Only those who got as far as stage three of the process, 20 per cent of those who begun, were sampled. The qualitative research involved youth aged 13-19 (20 interviews, six focus groups), teachers (eight interviews), volunteer team members (eight interviews) and programme managers in four project regions and in Moscow (five interviews). In the quantitative research 105 respondents took part, of whom 48 per cent were 13-16 years old, 44 per cent were 17-19 years old and 8 per cent were 20-23 years old. Both boys and girls were included in the sample.Findings – Young people’s participation in D4L had a significant positive impact on perceptions of SRHR and knowledge levels, changed some misconceptions about HIV/AIDS and helped develop social and healthy lifestyle skills. The programme contributed to the growth of voluntary activity and the organizational skills of participants. Teachers’ perceptions of SRHR changed positively after their participation in the programme.Research limitations/implications – The fact that the sample is only those who completed all stages of the programme, 20 per cent of the overall population who began it, is clearly a source of bias. The size of the quantitative research sample (n=105) does not allow disaggregation of data by region nor by gender: this limitation was minimized by choosing four regions with relatively comparable socio-economic status, and through quota sampling in equal proportions for boys and girls. This is the first time such a study has been conducted, so it is not possible to draw conclusions about the long-term impact of the programme.Practical implications – The short implementation period allows for the dissemination of information and training to large numbers despite limited funding.Social implications – The D4L approach provides information on SRHR to youth, which arouses their interest, and is perceived as relevant and important. Programme participants use this information themselves and share it with their friends, parents and other adults.Originality/value – The D4L programme is unique in Russia: there is no regular sexual education in Russian schools.

The paper deals with the instrumental study of phonetic markers of stress in compound (predominantly loan) disyllabic words in Standard Modern Russian (e. g. stop-krán 'emergency brake') as compared with non-compound native words of the same phonological structure (stoptát' 'tread down'). The paper states that compound disyllabic words under a phrase accent have both syllables stressed, stress being signalized by mid [o] // [e] vowels impossible in unstressed position in Standard Modern Russian. In non-compound native words unstressed [o] vowel in all types of phrase positions after ""hard"" consonants is displaced by [a] (unstressed [a] being about 10 percent longer than stressed [o]). Our data shows that in compound disyllabic words in a position with no tonal accent phonetically unstressed /o/ is realized by reduced [] (not standard [a]) vowel (being somewhat twice shorter than unstressed [a]). Thus, non-trivial [o] vowel reduction in compounds may serve as a phonetic cue of phonological stress which is shown up fully only under the tonal accent. Phonetically the units in question should be treated as a combination of two phonological words and phonetic data may be used as a ground for orthographic adaptation of loan word.","Phonetics; Rhythmical structure of phonological word; Vowel reduction; Word stress",,"","Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet","International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intellectual Technologies, Dialogue 2015","27 May 2015 through 30 May 2015",,117347,22217932,,,"Russian","Komp'ut.

In the political discourse, there was near dominance of a linear, kind of “vectorial” perception of global political trends: from the breakdown of various forms of autocracy to liberal democracy and market economy. It was as if, with the collapse of Communism, only one universal political goal and one anticipated political end result of global dynamic remained on the agenda – liberal democracy and free market economy. There seemed to be only one dominant political trajectory of democratization that should be pursued by all nations of the world: Karl Marx “upside down,” or Communist Manifesto per contra: all nations sooner or later will become liberal democracies – some earlier, others later. The world was perceived as flexible and “plastic” – you can “craft” (not “breed”!) democracy (Di Palma 1991) as you know “the” proper institutional design and can master appropriate political engineering. Democracy was perceived as a universal value and model with a specific invariant (though maybe not the concrete form) that would fit all nations despite all their differences in history, culture, levels of development, and so on (Sen 1999). However, twenty years since then, the world looks very different. As if after a global political “big bang,” we can see and experience an incredible multiplicity of political trajectories – kinds of “receding political galaxies” rushing in all possible directions and defying traditional regime typologies. Hopes or illusions about one single, uniform vector of global political development – from authoritarianism to democracy – are practically forgotten. There is much talk nowadays about the “democratic rollback” (Diamond 2008a), “authoritarian diffusion” (Ambrosio 2010), “democratic stagnation,” “postdemocracy” (Crouch 2003), threats of degeneration into ochlocracy, and “audience democracy” (Manin 1997). Democratic accomplishments of previous decades are considered as “lexical victories” of democracy (Dunn 2010). © Adam Przeworski 2015.",,,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9781107282070; 9781107053397,,"English","Democracy in a Russian Mirror",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952669315

To do such a comparison, we used both corpora as training sets to learn vector word representations and found the nearest neighbors or associates for all top-frequency nominal lexical units. Then the difference between these two neighbor sets for each word was calculated using the Jaccard similarity coefficient.

Design/methodology/approach – Drawing on a literature review, the study determines management challenges by implementation of organizational learning in the Russian business context. Taking this into account, the authors suggest specific model of organizational learning which contains organizational learning processes, organizational culture oriented towards learning and transformational leadership. Empirical justification of this model is provided using a sample of more than 100 respondents. Partial least squares-analysis is applied to define structural relationships between the elements of proposed model. Findings – The study reveals the positive and significant influence of transformational leadership and an organizational culture on organizational learning processes. Moreover, transformational leadership is shown to have a positive impact on an organizational culture, confirming the hypothesis regarding the pivotal role of leaders in the Russian business context. Research limitations/implications – The findings of this study can assist managers doing business in Russia to improve organizational learning processes. The size of the sample appears to be the main limitation of this study. Questions that might also be addressed in additional research concern the influence of organizational learning on the performance of Russian companies.

Nevertheless, manufacturers in more competitive wholesale markets may not have an incentive to reveal their prices to consumers.

Box 513, Eindhoven, Netherlands","Process mining techniques aim to analyze and improve conformance and performance of processes using event data. Process discovery is the most prominent process-mining task: A process model is derived based on an event log. The process model should be able to capture causalities, choices, concurrency, and loops. Process discovery is very challenging because of trade-offs between fitness, simplicity, precision, and generalization. Note that event logs typically only hold example behavior and cannot be assumed to be complete (to avoid over fitting). Dozens of process discovery techniques have been proposed. These use a wide range of approaches, e.g., language- or state-based regions, genetic mining, heuristics, expectation maximization, iterative log-splitting, etc. When models or logs become too large for analysis, the event log may be automatically decomposed or traces may be clustered before discovery. Clustering and decomposition are done automatically, i.e., no additional information is used. This paper proposes a different approach where a localized event log is assumed. Events are localized by assigning a nonempty set of regions to each event. It is assumed that regions can only interact through shared events. Consider for example the mining of software systems. The events recorded typically explicitly refer to parts of the system (components, services, etc.). Currently, such information is ignored during discovery. However, references to system parts may be used to localize events. Also in other application domains, it is possible to localize events, e.g., communication events in an organization may refer to multiple departments (that may be seen as regions). This paper proposes a generic process discovery approach based on localized event logs. The approach has been implemented in ProM and experimental results show that location information indeed helps to improve the quality of the discovered models. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Data mining; Economic and social effects; Iterative methods; Maximum principle; Expectation - maximizations; Generic process; Localized events; Location information; Process Discovery; Process mining; Process Modeling; Software systems; Petri nets","","Springer Verlag","36th International Conference on Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency, Petri Nets 2015","21 June 2015 through 26 June 2015",,119609,03029743,9783319194875,,"English","Lect.

Given an unlabeled tree τ on n nodes and suffix links of its internal nodes, we ask the question ""Is τ a suffix tree?"", i.e., is there a string S whose suffix tree has the same topological structure as τ? We place no restrictions on S, in particular we do not require that S ends with a unique symbol. This corresponds to considering the more general definition of implicit or extended suffix trees. Such general suffix trees have many applications and are for example needed to allow efficient updates when suffix trees are built online. Deciding if τ is a suffix tree is not an easy task, because, with no restrictions on the final symbol, we cannot guess the length of a string that realizes τ from the number of leaves. And without an upper bound on the length of such a string, it is not even clear how to solve the problem by an exhaustive search. In this paper, we prove that τ is a suffix tree if and only if it is realized by a string S of length n-1, and we give a linear-time algorithm for inferring S when the first letter on each edge is known.

Design/methodology/approach – The sample includes 85 Russian equity funds for the period of 2013. First, Jensen’s alpha for each fund has been calculated, and then cross-sectional regression analysis has been used. While only a part of fund managers publish biographic sketches, the authors use the Heckman procedure to control for self-selection issues. Findings – The results support the idea that the individual characteristics indicate the possibility to earn abnormal alpha. Managers with economic education and with Moscow education perform better than others. Relationship between both fund performance measures and manager’s experience has inverted U-shape. Jensen’s alpha reaches its highest level at the point of 9 years, whereas beta – at 10 years of manager’s experience. Research limitations/implications – Investigation can be improved by including more variables that influence the disclosure of managers’ personal information, for example, by conducting surveys. Additionally, cross-sectional data restrict the analysis. Practical implications – The discovered characteristics of managers’ intellectual capital can be used as additional screening tool for the investor who is deciding on mutual fund choice in Russia. While individual intellectual capital is observable and more persistent in time in comparison with the past fund performance, such tool allows better decision-making. Originality/value – This is the first paper that explores which characteristics of Russian fund managers are connected with higher abnormal return (measured by Jensen’s alpha) and risk (beta) of mutual funds. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Equity funds; Individual intellectual capital; Jensen’s alpha; Russia",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,13683047,,,"English","Measuring Bus.

In this respect most interesting proved to be his views on hypothetical logics, especially from the point of view of his slogan ‘Pay attention to things not words’. Galen thinks that there are three ways in which a pair of states of affairs might be related: they might be in conflict, in consequence, or in neither relation. This Galen’s classification of relations between states of affairs might be represented in form of a specific ontological square. Traces of Galen’s conceptions are trailing in modern logic particularly in the systems of non-fregean and relevant logics having situational semantics. Thus, in the framework of non-fregean logic from “Q situationally involves P” follows “if P then Q” (but not vice versa) which meets Galen’s slogan. Rather different, more complicated situational semantics of relevant logic also displays the signs of Galen’s logical attitude. Such semantics allows to take into account the closeness of relevant implication to the natural language conditionals while in Galen’s reasoning we most often deal namely with conditionals which best of all describe the situations occurred during the disease diagnostics by virtue of its hypothetical nature. To some extent semantics of such conditional descriptions would be employed in computer medical diagnostics. In this case the modern physician inevitably should be a logician like he was in Galen’s time. © Vladimir L.

The European Commission often refers in its merger or antitrust decisions to the products (or services) of brand X that enter into competition on a relevant market with the products (or services) of brand Y. The term brand used in this context aims to provide a factual observation on the operation of the specific relevant market. No further inferences are made. Inquiring into the role of brands in this context is a simple exercise and offers little to the research question explored in this volume. However, the issue becomes more complex if one engages with the use of brands as an operational concept in EU competition law. Operational concepts connect theoretical concepts to simple factual observations. For instance, the operational concept of ‘market power’ connects a fact concerning the level of prices in a specific market at a certain point in time, which is partially an observable fact, with the theoretical construction of price theory, for instance the theoretical concept of monopoly or its antithesis, that of perfect competition, from which market power is a departure. These operational concepts help decision-makers to make inferences (they serve as analytical shortcuts) about the relation between the different facts they observe in order to assess causal relations and make predictions. It is now accepted that competition law makes extensive use of operational concepts transplanted from the discipline of economics, in particular neoclassical price theory. Yet its receptivity to operational concepts developed in other disciplines, management studies in particular, has been relatively limited. And here lies the core of the problem with regard to the engagement of EU competition law with the concept of ‘brands’. Although the discipline of economics and in particular neoclassical price theory perceives brands as a fact of economic life, until recently price theory has not made use of the term as an operational concept. Instead, economists prefer to focus on the semi-operational concepts of product differentiation, advertising or that of barriers to entry, which describe the consequences of the existence of brands, but do not engage directly with the concept of brand. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9781316216576; 9781107103467,,"English","Brands, Competition Law and IP",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954245173

However, relatively little is known about what greed is and does. This article reports on 5 studies that develop and test the 7-item Dispositional Greed Scale (DGS). Study 1 (including 4 separate samples from 2 different countries, total N = 6092) provides evidence for the construct and discriminant validity of the DGS in terms of positive correlations with maximization, self-interest, envy, materialism, and impulsiveness, and negative correlations with self-control and life satisfaction. Study 2 (N = 290) presents further evidence for discriminant validity, finding that the DGS predicts greedy behavioral tendencies over and above materialism. Furthermore, the DGS predicts economic behavior: greedy people allocate more money to themselves in dictator games (Study 3, N = 300) and ultimatum games (Study 4, N = 603), and take more in a resource dilemma (Study 5, N = 305). These findings shed light on what greed is and does, how people differ in greed, and how greed can be measured. In addition, they show the importance of greed in economic behavior and provide directions for future studies. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Economic behavior; Experimental games; Greed; Individual differences","adult; female; human; individuality; male; middle aged; personality; personality test; satisfaction; self control; social behavior; video game; young adult; Adult; Female; Humans; Individuality; Male; Middle Aged; Personal Satisfaction; Personality; Personality Tests; Self-Control; Social Behavior; Video Games; Young Adult",,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,00223514,,JPSPB,"English","J.

This question is important not only for regulators, but also for commercial banks if the implementation of the internal ratings and the advanced Basel Approach are discussed. We consider Russian commercial banks as a good example where proposal methods might be used. Firstly, a literature overview was supplemented with an analysis of the activities of rating agencies in Russia. Secondly, we discussed the methods and algorithms of the comparison of rating scales. The optimization task was formulated and the system of rating maps onto the basic scale was obtained. As a result we obtained the possibility of a comparison of different agencies’ ratings. We discussed not only the distance method, but also an econometric approach. The scheme of correspondence for Russian banks is presented and discussed. The third part of the paper presents the results of econometric modeling of the international agencies’ ratings, as well as the probability of default models for Russian banks. The models were obtained from previous papers by the author, but complex discussion and synergy of their systematic exploration were this paper’s achievement. We consider these problems using the example of financial institutions. We discuss the system of models and their implementation for practical applications towards risk management tasks, including those which are based on public information and a remote estimation of ratings. We expect the use of such a systemic approach to risk management in commercial banks as well as in regulatory borders. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Econometric model; Mapping; Rating; Rating scale; Risk management",,,"Springer International Publishing",,,,,,9783319099460; 9783319099453,,"English","Financial Econometrics and Empiri.

The article presents in detail theoretical provisions on each approach and their application for academic motivation analysis is reviewed. Based on 37 half-structured interviews with students of two regionaluniversities there is demonstrated the specifics and advantages of each of the theories. The self-determination theory in its expanded version turned out to be more efficient while studying the students' motivation. It suggests a more detailed typology of motivation, provides more differentiated explanations of causes encouraging students for a more active involvement into the study process. Additionally, it suggests a system of internal motivation resources based on three identified needs: autonomy, competency and relatedness. The theory advantage is that it enables the explanation of the dynamics of various types of encouraging motives: situational, contextual and global. However, the reviewed theories are complementary in their essence, since they are focusing on various aspects of academic motivation: in the spotlight of the achievement goal orientation theory is a study of students' aims for their involvement into the study process, whereas the hierarchal self-determination theory refers to the research of root causes of being involved into the study process.","Academic motivation; Achievement goal orientation theory; External motivation; Hierarchical self-determination theory; Internal motivation; Mastery goal; Performance goal",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"English","Vopr.

First, the authors describe the framework within which their research on this matter is conducted, basing it on the theory of legal argumentation. Applying this framework to the investigation of Russian court practice has enabled the authors to discover important features, which they argue are characteristic of legal reasoning of the judiciary in this category of cases. In particular, the authors note that, at least until the present, the Russian Constitutional Court has chosen to abstain from crafting principles of legal policy regarding religious issues. Furthermore, in religious cases, the Russian judiciary - by and large - does not follow the jurisprudence of the ecthr, and the Russian Supreme Court has no clear-cut policy in handling these cases. In such a situation, ordinary judges choose individual strategies. These are indispensable insomuch as fidelity to the letter of the law is inadequate for adjudicating such cases. Russian court practice (from 1997 on) in religious cases can be more easily understood from this perspective than it can in the light of presumed political influence. © 2015 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","European Court of Human Rights; freedom of conscience; human rights; judicial protection; legal argumentation; legal principles; religion; Russian judicial system",,,"Martinus Nijhoff Publishers",,,,,09259880,,,"English","Rev.

Such expectations normally shape during the first years of their children spent in school. The major drawback for successful passing of FST and USE are believed to be poor training programs, whereas less than 20% refer to poor quality teaching. In parents' view, students' passing of FST and USE is accompanied by a series of challenges: starting from their persuasion being that exams are an inadequate tool for knowledge assessment to a fear of being unable to ensure they children a proper preparation to the exams.

Design/methodology/approach – The study is carried out in three steps. The first stage comes to identify the coordinates of intangibles in which strategic profiles are found. The second stage enables a clusterization of more than 1,600 European companies observed during seven years in the coordinates of intangibles. The last step introduces comparative analysis of these clusters in terms of their performance. Findings – As a result of empirical analysis three strategic profiles regarding intangibles are discovered. Two of these profiles are called intangible-intensive as they demonstrate clear predominance of a particular set of intangibles. The innovative profile is associated with intensive investment in innovation and networking capabilities. The conservative profile puts emphasis on managerial capabilities and development of business process. The non-intangible-intensive profile, that has been called moderate, evenly allocates resources among intangibles keeping them on a low level relative to the intangible-intensive profiles. Practical implications – This research is useful for practitioners in strategic and knowledge management.

Changing political circumstances, including the Tsars' orders concerning the representation of the Russian Empire's past and nationbuilding projects propagated by Russian elites constituted key variables. Between 1812 and 1914, preachers, artists, journalists, rulers, military officers, authors of memoirs, civil and military historians, writers and journalists participated in a dispute over the 'heroes' and 'villains' of the 1812 war. The present study draws on sources from the 19th and early 20th century such as the history of Aleksandr Michailovskii Danilevskii, the memoirs of Aleksei Er-molov, Nadezhda Durova and Denis Davydov, lyrics by Vasilii Zhukovskii, and Lev Tolstoi's novel War and Peace. It compares and contrasts these author's statements and ideas with the visual, poetic, journalistic and commemorative imagery of their time. Such an approach helps explain how heroic characters were designed and demonstrates the ambivalence of their positions: the frequently cyclical dynamic of appearance and disappearance from mainstream narratives of Russian history. This approach also allows for the attribution of individual narratives to specific discursive genres. Genetic source criticism was applied when analyzing War and Peace. Tolstoi's drafts and notes are examined to reveal the ways in which his concept of the novel changed over time, including gradual revisions in the shaping of characters and the use of the memories of war veterans to create a grand narrative. All this allows for an identification of the techniques Tolstoi applied when working with historical evidence, his recoding of the cultural and psychological profiles of certain characters, his retouching of contradictory elements, and his omission of a vast number of facts. The authors conclude that the heroization techniques applied in these narratives strongly depended upon the philosophy of history of their time. Thus, in the 1820-30's the trend towards romanticizing and nationalizing the Russian past manifested itself in a desacralization of Emperor Alexander I and a substitution of the idea of a ""people's war"" for that of a ""holy war"". By contrast, Lev Tolstoi's national project meant that the writer depersonalized war and heroized the Russian family and the Russian people. Later on, this discourse was reinforced through the sociologization of the writing of history, which meant that historians presented the war of 1812 as a clash of abstract interests, processes, and groups, to which the names of heroes served as accessories. © Franz Steiner Verlag GmbH, Stuttgart/Germany.",,,,"Franz Steiner Verlag Wiesbaden GmbH",,,,,00214019,,,"German","Jahrb.

It is assumed that the same psycholinguistic levels of word-retrieval breakdown can account for the mistakes of both groups.

The prevalence of childlessness in Russia is estimated on the basis of the 2002 and 2010 National Census data. The third wave of the Russian Generation and Gender Survey (GGS-Russia, 2011) and the second wave of the Moscow and its Citizens Survey (MaCS, 2013) form the basis for childlessness determinants modeling. The study demonstrates the existence of relatively broad childlessness in Russia and proves its recent growth from low to middle range. The prevalence of eventual childlessness as well as of zero child preferences appears to be significantly higher in Moscow compared to the rest of the country. In the capital city childless intentions are widespread among 40-49-year-old well-educated and well-paid individuals who are the only children in the parental family and who do not consider official marriage or having children to be prerequisites for happiness. With regard to the rest of the country, only higher age, biological infertility and absence of a partner are significant determinants of zero child preferences. Thus, in Moscow, apart from involuntary or circumstantial childlessness we may be capturing the first sprouts of voluntary childlessness, while in the rest of the country we observe only the first two types of behavior. © 2015.

These properties are crucial in many application areas, e.g. workflow modeling, embedded systems design, and bioinformatics.

It is reasoned that as institutionalization increases, so does the difficulty of attaining direct information about events and people that would be consequential for any given individual. As a result, gossip should increase with institutionalization, and complexity generally. This general hypothesis is tested against data from a sample of recent and historical societies. The analysis finds support for the hypothesis and also explores the relationship between gossip and gender autonomy. The results are discussed in terms of understanding gossip as a strategy for attaining information when direct information gathering is inhibited by one’s social structural circumstances.

The institutional perspective concentrates on the interplay of intergovernmental, transgovernmental, and transnational levels. The thematic perspective differentiates between values and concepts, policy-specific goals and implementation instruments. Together the three perspectives create a new methodological approach for the study of EU– Russian relations. The analysis of the EU–Russian Partnership for Modernisation (P4M) illustrates its rigour. The approach demonstrates how P4M is reinforced at the level of EU member states. It reveals how the transgovernmental and transnational levels have developed, changing the quality of EU–Russian relations.

Quite often this activity is related to state regulation. We provide evidence from rural Russia suggesting that state shirking also can give rise to informal economic relations. Empirical data from Altai Krai show that informal transfers from farms to rural municipalities are used to provide rural social sector. Despite the collapse of socialist agricultural system, when rural communities existed under patronage of collective farms, substantial part of the privately owned post-Soviet farms still donate to rural municipalities and population. The article is based on the fieldwork conducted in Altai Krai in 2013 when qualitative data (informal interviews, group discussions, observations) were collected by the author and his colleagues. Gift-giving relations between agricultural producers and municipalities could be described as ""natural"" bottom-up pattern. We perceive these Soviet-style gift-giving relations as the way to mitigate the weaknesses both of the Russian state rural policy as well as market self-regulation mechanism. Despite it could slow down economic performance of farms, it is the way to prevent rural degradation and depopulation.","Altai Krai; Gift; Informal economy; Rural communities; Rural policy; Rural Russia; Social sector",,,"University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn",,,,,20811128,,,"English","Prz.

Design/methodology/approach - The methodology is based on a combination of a quantitative survey (December 2004-February 2005) of former Russian Humbsoldtians and qualitative research (expert interviews in 2005 and in 2012, respectively) of Russian alumni of the Alexander von Humboldt foundation (Germany). Findings - For Russian elite researchers participating in academic mobility, in 2000s it is rather cross-border mobility' brain circulation' rather than ""brain drain"" a dominant form of academic mobility typical. Even in 2000s, western foundations still played a significant while twofold role -promoting emigration of for a small part of Russian elite researchers, on the one hand, while and getting access to top-level labs, etc. and to international academic chains of excellence for the majority of them, on the other. Coming back to the home country, affiliation with foreign foundations reduces the dependence of Russian elite researchers on hierarchical structures within the national state science system and promotes project teams and network forms of interaction their career. However, Russian scientists dependence on foreign funding affect both the scope of research and their academic status (mostly - second-level positions within research projects, etc.). Among the reasons to for leave leaving Russia it is primarily the desire to remain have closer access to their academic community and the equipment to do on the top level in research. The paper formulates some measures to foster incentives to stay in Russia and respectively to support re-emigration of elite researchers, in form of world class research labs and strengthening the motivation of senior researchers to work in the home country. Research limitations/implications - Research limitations consist in using of only one of the alumni networks of several western foundations database.

From these results, we empirically show that, in practical implementation and evaluation of a goMapReduce model, the degree of OS's support for distributed processing encountered in solving the resulting word counting problem is crucial.

The concept of entangled relational spaces is the main analytical tool of this article. Seeking to overcome identity-based essentialisms, the article deconstructs gender identity and demonstrates how it can be articulated and interpreted in different relational spaces. It extends the argument that oppressions are produced by various social categories (intersectionality) by adding that a single social category may beget various forms of oppression and that heterogeneous gender asymmetries are produced and manifested across different relational spaces. Evidence deriving from predominantly indigenous sources authored by women enabled the discussion of gendered power asymmetries in economic, legal, and political spaces produced by corresponding relations. Economic and demographic crises, which the indigenous peoples of Siberia endured in the 1910s–1920s, reduced gendered power asymmetries in economic spaces making women less dependent on men. On women's initiative the shifts then spread to legal spaces and, with the support of the Bolshevik government, affected political spaces. These shifts were closely connected to the early Soviet attempts at dialog with indigenous people, decolonizing Siberia and liberating indigenous women, and gave way to instrumental policies. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","asymmetry; indigenous peoples; relational spaces; Siberia; USSR",,,"Routledge",,,,,0966369X,,,"English","Gender Place Cult.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930573989

Vinogradov Russian Language Institute of RAS, Moscow, Russian Federation","The paper presents clustering experiments on Russian verbs based on the statistical data drawn from the Russian FrameBank (framebank.ru). While lexicology has essentially abandoned the idea of syntactic transformations as the primary basis for grouping verbs into semantic classes (Apresjan 1967, Levin 1993), the hypothesis of the same lexical and syntactic distributional profiles underlying lexical clusters is still attractive. In computational linguistics, some attempts have been made to obtain verb classes for English, German and other languages using observable morpho-syntactic and lexical properties of context (Dorr and Jones 1996; Lapata 1999; Schulte im Walde 2006; Lenci 2014, among others). Our experiments on semantic classification of Russian verbs are based on two types of tags embedded in the annotation of argument constructions: A) semantic roles and b) morpho-syntactic patterns. The domain of speech verbs is classified automatically on vectors, and the resulting clusters are contrasted against Babenko (2007)'s semantic classes and three other manual classifications. The classes within the domain of possessive verbs are constructed using rule-based solutions and evaluated against Berkeley FrameNet verb clusters. We conclude that clustering on morpho-syntactic (pure formal) patterns loses the race to more intelligent approaches which take into account semantic roles.","Frame semantics; FrameBank; FrameNet; Lexical classifications; Lexicology; Morpho-syntax; Russian language; Semantic roles; Verb",,"","Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet","International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intellectual Technologies, Dialogue 2015","27 May 2015 through 30 May 2015",,117347,22217932,,,"English","Komp'ut.

This molecularly doped polymer (MDP) has been shown to exhibit perfectly flat plateaus on its time-of-flight curves with optical excitation. Our TOF results with continuously changing electron energies, as well as numerical calculations using a multiple trapping model with a Gaussian trap distribution (MTMg), suggest that charge carrier transport in this molecularly doped polymer is nonequilibrium and the flat plateaus can be explained by the presence of a thin surface layer depleted of transport material. The depleted surface layers on samples of this molecularly doped polymer are extremely thin (less than 0.12 μm), with those relating to the release side (contacting a substrate during coating/drying procedure) being much smaller than for the free side exposed to air. Since TPD-doped PC and a tetraphenylbenzidine polymer containing the TPD moiety in its main chain served as the prototype materials for the concept of ""trap-free"" carrier transport, we have also discussed this in detail. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Amines; Carrier transport; Electron energy levels; Electron guns; Phenols; Polycarbonates; Polymers; Bisphenol a polycarbonates; Freestanding films; Molecularly doped polymers; Multiple trapping; Numerical calculation; Thin surface layer; Transport materials; Trap distributions; Free flight",,"American Chemical Society",,,,,19327447,,,"English","J.

The Capitalist Peace thesis emphasizes trade and the rise of knowledge economies as the forces driving peace. Complementing these interpretations, we present empirical evidence of a cultural change that is making peace more desirable to the publics of most societies around the world. Analyzing public opinion data covering 90% of the world’s population over three decades, we demonstrate that improving existential conditions elevate the life opportunities of growing population segments and lead them to become increasingly tolerant of diversity and place growing emphasis on self-realization. In recognition of life’s rising opportunities, people’s valuation of life changes profoundly: readiness to sacrifice one’s life gives way to an increasing insistence on living it, and living it the way one chooses. Hence, pro-choice values rise at the same time as willingness to sacrifice lives in war dwindles. Historical learning based on the specific experiences of given societies has also changed their publics’ willingness to fight in wars. This transformation of worldviews places interstate peace on an increasingly solid mass basis. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","democratic peace; emancipative values; freedom ladder; historical learning; life opportunities; long peace; modernization; war; willingness to fight",,,"SAGE Publications Ltd",,,,,00223433,,,"English","J.

The experiments were performed in the course of Russian Semantic Similarity Evaluation track, where our models took from 2nd to 5th position, depending on the task. We introduce the tools and corpora used, comment on the nature of the evaluation track and describe the achieved results. It was found out that Continuous Skip-gram and Continuous Bag-of-words models, previously successfully applied to English material, can be used for semantic modeling of Russian as well. Moreover, we show that texts in Russian National Corpus (RNC) provide an excellent training material for such models, outperforming other, much larger corpora. It is especially true for semantic relatedness tasks (although stacking models trained on larger corpora on top of RNC models improves performance even more). High-quality semantic vectors learned in such a way can be used in a variety of linguistic tasks and promise an exciting field for further study.","Distributional semantics; Machine learning; Neural embeddings; Semantic similarity; Vector word representations; Word2vec",,"","Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet","International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intellectual Technologies, Dialogue 2015","27 May 2015 through 30 May 2015",,117347,22217932,,,"English","Komp'ut.

This approach may lead to misunderstanding, especially in cases when scientific classification (e. g. in biology) differs from what is found in natural language data. One of such cases is discussed here, namely the small but rather interesting class of nuts (Russian orexi). In the botanic world view nuts usually include hazelnuts and chestnuts, but do not include almonds (which are considered stone fruits), pine nuts (seeds), peanuts (legumes), pistachio (kernels), etc. The Russian orex, English nut, Latin nux exhibit similar behaviour here. Explanatory dictionaries of Russian more or less follow the botanical definitions, even though in many fields (such as cooking, food industry, medicine, etc.) nuts are classified differently. In order to establish the boundaries of nuts in Russian, more than 1,000 native speakers were questioned and multiple texts of different periods were studied. The result is a peculiar class which could not be identified with any of the natural language supercategories described by Anna Wierzbicka. A new lexicographic description is proposed for some words included into this class.","Classificaton; Everyday word usage; Lexicography; Meaning evolution; Naïve world view; Nuts; Polysemy; Semantics; Surveys; Terminology",,"","Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet","International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intellectual Technologies, Dialogue 2015","27 May 2015 through 30 May 2015",,117347,22217932,,,"Russian","Komp'ut.

In comparison with the quality of life of the population, the quality of population itself is studied far less. The article presents an expanded characteristic of human potential in seven directions: economic activity, demographic processes, physical health, cultural potential, social health, educational potential and the attitude of the population to the environment. On the basis of statistics for 2008-2012 years, 63 indicators of human potential for all directions are selected. In the final result, the correlation analysis has led to the substantiation of the system of indicators consisting of 10 indicators. Three economic and seven social indicators characterizing human potential are included into this system. On the basis of the indicators by means of hierarchical agglomerative methods of cluster analysis, a classification of the Russian regions is carried out in two versions: with economic indicators and without them. The result of the calculations is a stable temporal typology of regions by indicators of human potential covering 74.4 % of the population of Russia. The article provides a substantial interpretation of dividing regions into groups, identifies the strengths and weaknesses of each cluster, shows the specific features of the regions included into the clusters. The obtained results can be used in the development of measures for the reduction of the interregional inequality in terms of human potential. It is possible to define what measures can be effective by studying the strategic directions of the development of regions in the cluster which is the most successful regarding the characteristics of human potential.","Cluster analysis; Economic indicators; Human potential; Human resources; Interregional analysis; Quality of population; Regional level; Social indicators; Subjects of the Federation; Typology of regions",,,"Institute of Economics, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences",,,,,20726414,,,"Russian","Econ.

In the one extreme, a database can be set up to provide the results of a single known query so that the use of available of resources are maximized and response time minimized, but at the cost of all other queries being sub optimally executed. In the other extreme, when no query is known in advance, the database must provide the information without such optimization, normally resulting in inefficient execution of all queries. This paper introduces a novel technique, highly normalized Big Data using Anchor modeling, that provides a very efficient way to store information and utilize resources, thereby providing ad-hoc querying with high performance for the first time in massively parallel processing databases.

In addition, along with the ordered movements, the existence of a strange attractor is known. In such circumstances, the search for periodic solutions and their stability analysis is not a trivial problem. In order to find periodic solutions of the dynamical systems, we offer an interactive computer algorithm based on finding the initial conditions corresponding to the periodic solutions with the possibility of interactive intervention and operational control of the computing process. We demonstrate the algorithm and various numerical examples of finding new and complex stable and unstable periodic solutions in strongly nonlinear dynamical systems with one and two degrees of freedom.

Analysis of syntactic and morphosyntactic properties of these two subclasses shows that items traditionally labeled as inflected postpositions form a homogeneous group and show noun-like behavior in most cases, while non-inflected postpositions are heterogeneous. Based on this analysis, we propose to single out a part-of-speech class of relational nouns and show that the rest of the postpositions could be further divided into subclasses with different behavior.

A combination of rich naval traditions, enormous economic potential, technological expertise and independent foreign policy puts Russia in a category of global sea powers. That is exactly how it looked for most of the 20th century. Suffice to say that by the end of the Cold War era, Soviet warships and nuclear submarines posed a serious challenge to the US Navy. In the 1990s came a drastic decline in the naval capabilities of the country, but it did not last long-at any rate, not in historical terms. The early 21st century has been marked by an effort to rebuild the Russian Navy and increase its activities. Whilst trying to modernise its naval potential, Russia does not aim to change the status quo and expand its sphere of influence at the expense of others. Its primary purpose is to discourage other powers from dragging it into conflicts which, in the case of Russia’s involvement and given its size and military might, could aggravate the international geopolitical order. This course is generally conducive to a greater polycentrism in global naval affairs, and a more stable world. © National Maritime Foundation.",,,,"Routledge",,,,,19466609,,,"English","Marit.

At the same time, they define the idea of good motherhood not only through the internalization of, and compliance with, the dominant cultural codes, but also by relying on the biographical experience they have had. © Berghahn Journals.","Adulthood; Biography; Discursive work; Good mothering; Teenage mothers",,,"Berghahn Journals, Ltd",,,,,19388209,,,"English","Girlhood Stud.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973450868

The strain rate tensor includes three components: elastic and two inelastic related to the active deformation of the cells and their rearrangement. The first of these components depends on the stresses in the cells and the reached cellular deformation level, whereas the second is determined by the active stresses.

The minimal layer for which no such characterization is known is the factorial one. A possible approach to obtaining such a characterization could be through identifying all minimal superfactorial classes. However, no such class is known and possibly no such class exists.

I will show that the fact that the 'n'-forms are essentially variants is better accounted for by the notion of 'trigger' of a morphological variant. To my eyes, this opens ways to a better understanding of the observed evidence than that using the conventional notion of morphosyntactic controller, on the one hand-and certainly than explaining them in (morpho)phonological terms. In the end, I will briefly argue that, in a sense, the evolution of the alternation is similar to degrammaticalization, showing a movement from a morphophonologically conditioned external sandhi to a morphosyntactic category similar to government.","Case; Morphology; Preposition; Pronouns; Russian; Russian National Corpus; Sandhi",,"","Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet","International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intellectual Technologies, Dialogue 2015","27 May 2015 through 30 May 2015",,117347,22217932,,,"English","Komp'ut.

In other words, the statistical decision is particularly sensitive in a small neighbourhood of the particular value γ = 1/2. For this aim the concept of the weighted differential entropy introduced in [1] is used when it is necessary to emphasize the frequency. It was found that the weight in suggested form does not change the asymptotic form of Shannon, Renyi, Tsallis and Fisher entropies, but changes the constants.

It was found that in both models far tails are non-Gaussian. In the dipolar glass model, the DOS is symmetric around zero energy, while for the model of quadrupolar glass, the DOS is generally asymmetric and its asymmetry is directly related to the particular geometry of quadrupoles. Far tails of the DOS are relevant for the quasi-equilibrium transport of the charge carriers at low temperature. Asymmetry of DOS in quadrupolar glasses means a principal inequivalence of the random energy landscape for the transport of electrons and holes.

Particularly, it is shown that when the trader can treat share price values from the portfolio as random variables with known (to her) distributions, an optimal portfolio composition is found by solving a linear programming problem. Otherwise, this optimal composition is found as the trader’s equilibrium strategy in an antagonistic two-person game with the stock exchange being the other player.

In the literature the idea of a permanent methodological crisis in psychology, lasting since the 1890s, dominates. We contest this view and argue that the contemporary methodological problems in psychology should be considered within the context of the novel and larger crisis challenging all socio-humanitarian knowledge in the face of the transformations in social reality in recent decades. The nature of these transformations and their implications for the theory and methodology of the socio-humanitarian sciences are analyzed by drawing on the sociological literature, which is more sensitive to changes in social life than is psychology. Prominent sociologists argue that the ""old"" theories and interpretations of the ""social"" are no longer relevant in the new, highly complex, and globally unstable reality; this new reality has largely transformed the dimensions of human beings' existence. Meanwhile psychology still tends to comprehend the universal nature of the human. This position undermines the relevance of both psychology's theoretical models and the practical implications derived from these methodological assumptions. We argue for revision of the perennial psychological problem of the biology-culture interaction in human nature. To resolve the contemporary methodological crisis in psychology, a shift is needed from theories of universal and immutable human nature to the idea of the human as an infinitely changing creature. Because culture is, primarily, the ability to change, wherein the speed and extent of changes are unique for humans, distinguishing them from other living beings.","Biosocial problem; Crisis in sociology; General crisis of socio-humanitarian sciences; Human nature; Methodological crisis; Social reality; Social transformations",,,"Russsian Psychological Society",,,,,20746857,,,"English","Psychol.

This implies that a different approach is necessary. We propose to use some dataflow computational model views to specify embedded systems, because it is a notation that covers the most relevant aspects of distributed computing. In this paper, we introduce a new computational model, known as OAA (Object-Attribute Architecture) and present the general characteristics of an OA-methodology to support the design and simulation of distributed computing systems. The matrix multiplication algorithm in the object-attribute distributed computing environment has been used to validate our methodology. The preliminary evaluation results show the feasibility of the OA approach. © 2015 The Authors.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of these two countries in regional volatility by examining their effect on two separate phenomena: financial volatility, defined here as long-term interrelations, and contagion, a more short-term phenomenon. Utilizing bivariate DCC-GARCH modeling, this paper estimates long-term volatility spillover effects and short-term contagion effects and their origins during several periods of financial crisis in the Central and Eastern European region. Our results show that the long-term impact of volatility in the Russian market is much more substantial than that of Poland in Central and Eastern Europe, with this disparate impact corresponding to each country’s level of market capitalization. Additionally, our results show that Russia served as a source of short-term contagion for neighboring countries during its banking crisis in 2004 and during the Russian stock market fall in 2008. Poland had comparatively less effect on the region during the Global Financial Crisis. Moreover, the entrance of Poland into the European Union in May 2004 had no impact on stock markets in the region in terms of enhancing contagion. © 2015, Journal of Applied Economic Sciences.

Psychology, both as science and practice, has been largely developed in one cultural area of the world: Europe and North America. As a result, the discipline is culture-bound, limited in its origins, concepts, and empirical findings to only this small portion of the world. The discipline is also cultureblind, largely ignoring the influence of the role of culture in shaping the development and display of human behaviour. These limitations have resulted in the dominant position of a Western Academic Scientific Psychology (WASP) in relation to other cultural perspectives on human behaviour. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach? This paper draws on concepts and strategies in psychology (particularly cross-cultural and intercultural psychology) to propose some remedies to problems arising from the dominant WASP position. For example, of what relevance is such a limited perspective to understanding human activity in other cultures; and how can such a limited understanding serve the purpose of effective intercultural interactions? Findings? The eventual goal is to achieve a global psychology that incorporates concepts and findings from societies and cultures from all parts of the world, one that will permit a valid understanding of people within their cultures, and permit effective intercultural across cultures. Originality/value? The paper presents some criticisms of the dominant western psychology (WASP), and proposes that the achievement of a more global psychology may be within reach if some concepts and methods now available in psychology from both the dominant western sources and from those working in the rest of the world are used. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Acculturation; Acculturation strategies; Cross-cultural psychology; Culture-blind; Culture-bound; Dominance; Global psychology; Indigenous psychology; Intercultural psychology; Prevention strategies; Universalism",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,13527606,,,"English","Cross.

Two of them are conventional ones, scoring the impact over (a) citation metrics and (b) merit metrics. The third one relates to the level of results. It involves a taxonomy of the research field, that is, a hierarchy representing its composition. The impact is evaluated according to the taxonomy ranks of the subjects that have emerged or have been crucially transformed due to the results by the scientist under consideration Mirkin (Control Large Syst Spec Issue 44:292– 307, 2013). To aggregate criteria in approaches (a) and (b) we use an in-house automated criteria weighting method oriented towards as tight a representation of the strata as possible Orlov (Bus Inf, 2014). To compare the approaches empirically, we use publicly available data of about 30 scientists in the areas of data analysis and machine learning. As our taxonomy of the field, we invoke a corresponding part of the ACM Computing Classification System 2012 and slightly modify it to better reflect results by the scientists in our sample. The obtained ABC stratifications are rather far each other.

Taking into account theoretical approaches to the phenomenon of coreference we based our research on the following assumption: The recognition of coreference links for different structural types of noun phrases is regulated by different language mechanisms. The other starting point was that different languages allow pronominal chaining of different length and that coreference chains properties differ for the languages with different strategies for zero anaphora and different systems for definiteness marking.

Based on the category of social theory and empirical evidence, inclusion is presented as a strategic goal of international organizations, state social policy, as well as a characteristic of everyday life of any social service. Inclusion is formed in the professional activity within specific organizations and, in a wider context, in the course of reform of social policy, with the change of values and needs of the population. At the organizational level inclusion is presented in three aspects: official measures, professional practice, and culture manifested in the interactions of the participants of an inclusive process, their relationship, shared values and attitudes. It is shown that an inclusive culture becomes embedded within an organization when all professionals share the values of respect for human rights and diversity, participation, mutual learning and dialogue with clients. Based on materials from interviews with social work specialists, inclusion of migrants is studied in the context of professional organizational culture. Necessity to take into account inclusion as a parameter in evaluating social services is argued for. © 2015 r.","Evaluation; Inclusion; Social policy; Social services; Workers",,,"Russian Academy of Sciences",,,,,01321625,,,"Russian","Sotsiologicheskie Issled.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962585643

We showed how to eliminate the MIRR's dependence on a finance rate and proved that in this case the MIRR becomes the ""equivalent rate of return"" proposed by Solomon. The generalized internal rate of return (GIRR) and generalized external rate of return (GERR) indices based on the generalized net present value (GNPV) approach are considered as alternatives to the MIRR. Several nonconventional projects have been evaluated using the MIRR, GIRR, and GERR rules. In order to verify the estimates, we drew up a simple project balance sheet, which demonstrated correctness of the results based on the GIRR and GERR rules and errors inherent in the MIRR application.

Indicators of the low life expectancy, high mortality caused by external reasons (alcoholism, murders, suicides, etc.), and high migration of youth are seen as the objective indicators of social problems in the local communities.

For example, event logs can be used to automatically learn a process model (e.g., a Petri net or BPMN model). Next to the automated discovery of the real underlying process, there are process mining techniques to analyze bottlenecks, to uncover hidden inefficiencies, to check compliance, to explain deviations, to predict performance, and to guide users towards “better” processes. Dozens (if not hundreds) of process mining techniques are available and their value has been proven in many case studies. However, existing techniques focus on the analysis of a single process rather than the comparison of different processes. In this paper, we propose comparative process mining using process cubes. An event has attributes referring to the dimensions of the process cube. Through slicing, dicing, rolling-up, and drilling-down we can view event data from different angles and produce process mining results that can be compared. To illustrate the process cube concept, we focus on educational data. In particular, we analyze data of students watching video lectures given by the first author. The dimensions of the process cube allow us to compare the process of students that passed the course versus the process of students that failed. We can also analyze differences between male and female students, between different parts of the course, and between Dutch students and international students. The initial analysis provided in this paper is used to elicit requirements for better tool support facilitating comparative process mining. ©  IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.","Comparative process mining; Learning analytics; Online analytical processing; Process mining","Compliance control; Data mining; Education; Education computing; Geometry; Petri nets; Automated discovery; Female students; International students; Learning analytics; On-line analytical processing; Process mining; Process Modeling; Single process; Students","Advanced Security Service Certificate for SOA","Springer Verlag","3rd IFIP WG 2.6, 2.12 International Symposium on Data-driven Process Discovery and Analysis, SIMPDA 2013","30 August 2013 through 30 August 2013",,114049,18651348,9783662464359,,"English","Lect.

However, the differing conditions of democratic Lithuanian and authoritarian Russian public governance offer different opportunities and set different constraints for neighbourhood mobilisation. The purpose is to contrast local community mobilisations under the two regimes and highlight the differences between and similarities in the activists' repertoires of actions in two distinct political and economic urban settings. Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs qualitative methodology using data from semi-structured interviews conducted with community activists and state officials, presented using a comparative case study design. Findings - Although, citizens' mobilisations in the two cities are reactions to the neoliberalisation of housing and local public space, they take different forms. In Vilnius they are institutionalised and receive formal support from national and local authorities. Moreover, support from the EU encourages organisational development and provides material and cognitive resources for grassroots urban mobilisations. In contrast, residents' mobilisations in Moscow are informal and face fierce opposition from local authorities. However, even in an authoritarian setting, grassroots mobilisations evolve using creative strategies to circumvent institutional constraints. Originality/value - Little attention has been paid to grassroots urban mobilisations in post-Soviet cities. There is also a lack of comparative attempts to show variation in post-Soviet urban activism related to housing and local public space. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Grassroots; Housing policy; Mobilizations; Moscow; Public space; Vilnius paper type research paper",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,0144333X,,,"English","Int.

Circumfical verbs are analyzed as involving the following steps of derivation. First, the activity event structure projected by a non-derived stem is augmented by the change-of-state component that turns it into an accomplishment even structure. Secondly, prefixation occurs that introduces the maximal degree of change along a relevant scale creating a transitive verb. Such a verb, however, is ill-formed since the changeof-state component has not been licensed via lexical insertion. To rescue the derivation, reflexivization is invoked, and the change-of-state subevent gets licensed through identification of its participant with the clausal subject. A wider theoretical implication of the analysis is that circumfixation, as a primitive type of affixation, is superfluous and is to be abandoned.","Accomplishments; Activities; Circumfixation; Derivational morphology; Event structure",,"","Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet","International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intellectual Technologies, Dialogue 2015","27 May 2015 through 30 May 2015",,117347,22217932,,,"Russian","Komp'ut.

Among them, there exist the so-called discrete TBCs whose advantages are the complete absence of spurious reflections, reliable computational stability, clear mathematical background and the corresponding rigorous stability theory. In this paper, the Strang-type splitting with respect to the potential is applied to three two-level schemes with different discretizations in space having the approximation order O(τ2+ |h|k), k D 2 or 4. Explicit forms of the discrete TBCs are given and results on existence, uniqueness and uniform in time L2-stability of solutions are stated in a unified manner.

Our MD calculations show an unexpectedly weak kinetics of the melting front propagation in graphite that is several orders slower than that in metals. We demonstrate that at sufficiently high heating rates (higher than 105 - 106 K/s) the temperatures 500-1000 K above the graphite melting temperature can be reached before the crystal decay.

They are related to the classical Ruijsenaars- Schneider system of N particles, which is known to be an integrable deformation of the Calogero-Moser system. As an explicit example the case N = 2 is considered in detail. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Chains; Hazards; Inverse problems; Matrix algebra; Spin dynamics; Classical mechanics; Inverse spectral problems; Many-body systems; Quantum Hamiltonians; Quantum spin chains; R matrices; Spectral problem; Spin chains; Mechanics","","Springer Science and Business Media, LLC","International School and Workshop on Nonlinear Mathematical Physics and Natural Hazards, 2013","28 November 2013 through 2 December 2013",,117199,09308989,9783319143279; 9783319143279,,"English","Springer Proc.

The actors implementing the internal effects minimize costs and receive benefits. If there are side effects (externalities), the other actors who had not participated directly in the internal effects implementation can obtain advantages and profits without bearing any costs. Externalities affect actors' motivations and encourage them to perform (or failure) some functions of the national innovation system (NIS). In order to achieve a rational combination of conflicting functions, it is necessary to reach certain proportions between the effects of actors' activities and the emerging externalities of these activities. The externalities and their impact on NIS processes are considered from the standpoint of a country passing a particular stage of technological development. The effectiveness of NIS actors' operations in the processes of knowledge transfer strongly depends on integration of national markets into global ones. The key mechanism of such integration is international competition. The positive externalities of international competition can create motivation for domestic actors of the NIS to innovate. However, if the competition is too intensive, it may lead to irreversible consequences for the domestic industries. At the same time, classic protectionism and high barriers to entry for foreign companies into domestic markets preserves the backward technological structure and thus serves as the main obstacles to economic development. The models of technology diffusion are considered to determine the possible ways of balancing positive and negative externalities of international competition on the investment stage of country's development. Much of the attention of the study focuses on such an externality as a technological spillover. On the investment stage, excessive suppression of technological spillover restricts entries of new domestic participants into markets and reduces their ability to further development of new products or production methods. The paper take into account the problem of choosing a degree of regulation of technological spillover and finding a balance between strict and lax protection of intellectual property rights. The examples of solving this problem for some countries are given. Finally, externalities of the bias in favour of a particular type of innovations are considered. These are the expansion of busyness research capacity and active business partnership and cooperation with external sources of R&D. So as to remove unfavorable structural changes caused by these externalities, there is a need to achieve some balance between positive and negative their influences.","Business bias and preferences; Externalities; Innovation policy; International competition; Product and process innovations; Technological spillover","Commerce; Competition; Innovation; Intellectual property; International trade; Investments; Knowledge management; Laws and legislation; Motivation; Rational functions; Externalities; Innovation policies; International competitions; Process Innovation; Technological spillovers; Economics","","Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited","10th European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE 2015","17 September 2015 through 18 September 2015",,119231,20491050,9781910810491,,"English","Proc.

We show that when the polymer chain conformation is a coil, application of external electric field leads to its additional swelling. However, when the polymer conformation is a globule, a sufficiently strong field can induce a globule-coil transition. We show that such ""field-induced"" globule-coil transition at the sufficiently small monomer polarizabilities goes quite smoothly. On the contrary, when the monomer polarizability exceeds a certain threshold value, the globule-coil transition occurs as a dramatic expansion in the regime of first-order phase transition.

More precisely, let X be the standard resolution of a transversal slice to an adjoint nilpotent orbit of a simple Lie algebra over C. An action of the affine braid group on the derived category Db(Coh(X)) and a collection of t-structures on this category permuted by the action have been constructed earlier by the last two authors and S. Riche. In this note we show that the t-structures come from points in a certain connected submanifold in the space of Bridgeland stability conditions. The submanifold is a covering of a submanifold in the dual space to the Grothendieck group, and the affine braid group acts by deck transformations. We also propose a new variant of definition of stabilities on a triangulated category, which we call a “real variation of stability conditions” and discuss its relation to Bridgeland’s definition. The main theorem provides an illustration of such a relation. We state a conjecture by the second author and A. Okounkov on examples of this structure arising from symplectic resolutions of singularities and its relation to equivariant quantum cohomology.

Moreover, a distinction between ""North"" and ""South"" regions seems appropriate for both countries. The purpose of this study is to identify key determinants of YURs in the Russian and Italian regions, for the period 2000-2009. We also search for the existence of distance spatial effects. In particular, we estimate a modified Arellano-Bond model for the regional YUR, including some explanatory and control variables (e.g. regional GDP in PPP, regional population density, regional total unemployment rate), together with year dummies and North/South dummies. The use of distance matrixes enables important analysis to be conducted on the role played by spatial effects, which turn out to be significant.

In fact, however, democracy might logically be expected to be especially responsive only to the people's desires, not their needs. Responses to people's objective needs can be substantially different from responses to their subjective desires. Democratic institutions therefore cannot guarantee (and may even hamper) responsiveness to basic human needs. Democracy, should, at least in principle, thus be confined to the sphere of wants rather than needs. © 2015 Critical Review Foundation.","accountability; democracy; needs; preferences; regime responsiveness; wants",,,"Routledge",,,,,08913811,,,"English","Crit.

To avoid the â curse of dimensionality', the original high-dimensional image data are transformed into their lower-dimensional features preserving certain subject-driven data properties. These properties can include âinformation-preserving' when using the constructed low-dimensional features instead of original high-dimensional vectors, as well preserving the distances and angles between the original high-dimensional image vectors. Under the commonly used Manifold assumption that the high-dimensional image data lie on or near a certain unknown low-dimensional Image manifold embedded in an ambient high-dimensional âõbservation' space, a constructing of the lower-dimensional features consists in constructing an Embedding mapping from the Image manifold to Feature space, which, in turn, determines a low-dimensional parameterization of the Image manifold.

In this paper we focus on the case of context-free filters. The algorithmic complexity of the RR problem is a very coarse measure of the complexity of context-free languages. This characteristic respects the rational dominance relation. We show that a RR problem for a maximal filter under the rational dominance relation is P-complete. On the other hand, we present an example of a P-complete RR problem for a nonmaximal filter.We show that RR problems for Greibach languages belong to the class NL.

We considered the formation of the main Human Development Index, caalculated annually by the United Nations, its composition and method of calculating the indicators, changes in the structure and calculation of the indicators of the HDI. According to the data of the 2014 United Nations Report, all countries of the world were divided into four groups: the countries with very high human development level, the countries with high human development level, the countries with medium human development level and the countries with low human development level. In the paper the complex analysis of human development is conducted for the group with very high level of development. In the study we suggested the method of selection of integrated, generalizing indicators using the method of dimension reduction – the method of principal components. By the method of principal components the generalizing integrated indicators, which allowed assessing living conditions of the population at the most generalized level, were identified. The principal factors were selected taking into account the total accumulated dispersion, Kaiser criterion and the scree plot. In the result of the recalculations with the axes rotation by the method of Varimax of initials, three principal components were obtained. The model of dependance of the Human Development Index (HDI) – y on the selected principal factors f1, f2 and f3 was built. The countries, included to the first group with very high human development level were classified using cluster analysis. The classification was carried out by the selected generalizing factors. In the result of hierarchical procedures for combining, we identified four groups of countries – four clusters, which confirm the differences in the conditions of human development in the group of countries with very high human development level. © MCSER-Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.","Cluster analysis; Generalizing indicators; Human development level; Method of principal components; Population life quality; Regression model",,,"Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research",,,,,20399340,,,"English","Mediterranean J.

In this work, we show a new approach to automatically infer sentiment-based β priors in topic models for sentiment analysis and opinion mining; the approach is based on the EM algorithm.

Scientific novelty of the rese arch is an approach to the assessment of the future number of pensioners, taking into account the regional dimension, which allows taking into consideration the territorial features of the socio-economic and demographic development of the Russian Federation. Demographic methods of forecasting, especially mortality tables used in actuarial practice are analyzed. According to the results of the demographic processes’ study of a particular region the models of age-specific mortality and table the disposal of the working-age population are constructed which formed the basis of the forecast of the pensioner number by types of pensions up to 2030. According to the study of regional demographic processes the models of age-specific mortality table and disposal of the working population were built, that served as the basis for the development of the forecast number of pensioners by type of retirement pensions until 2030. The age structure of pension recipients for age and gender is developed with five-year cohorts to estimate the potential number of working pensioners. The causes of the future pensioner structure changes are determined. The forecast of the number of old-age pensioners in the total population of the region is represented, if the retirement age is increased.

Since their earliest works in the area, the issue of temporal harmony attracted attention of researchers and practitioners alike, especially within the field of positive psychology. Here, we provide a deepened consideration of the nature of balanced time perspective, its origins, and consequences. Moreover, we review the existing empirical operationalizations of temporal harmony, both those derived from the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory and those created independently from it. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each method and reflect on future directions in research on the balanced time perspective issue. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,,"Springer International Publishing",,,,,,9783319073682; 9783319073675,,"English","Time Perspective Theory; Review, Research and Application: Essays in Honor of Philip G.

Typically, to solve this problem, a constraint for pattern selection is introduced. One of the first constraints proposed in pattern mining is support (frequency) of a pattern in a dataset. Frequency is an anti-monotonic function, i.e., given an infrequent pattern, all its superpatterns are not frequent. However, many other constraints for pattern selection are not (anti-)monotonic, which makes it difficult to generate patterns satisfying these constraints. In this paper we introduce the notion of projection-antimonotonicity and ϑ−∑oψια algorithm that allows efficient generation of the best patterns for some nonmonotonic constraints. In this paper we consider stability and Δ-measure, which are nonmonotonic constraints, and apply them to interval tuple datasets. In the experiments, we compute best interval tuple patterns w.r.t. these measures and show the advantage of our approach over postfiltering approaches. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Interval tuple Data; Nonmonotonic constraints; Pattern mining","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Anti-monotonicity; Exponential explosion; Infrequent patterns; Interval tuple Data; Monotonic functions; Nonmonotonic; Pattern mining; Pattern selection; Learning systems","","Springer Verlag","European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases, ECML PKDD 2015","7 September 2015 through 11 September 2015",,140579,03029743,9783319235240; 9783319235240; 9783319235240; 9783319235240,,"English","Lect.

Through simulation experiments various “what if“ questions can be answered and redesign alternatives can be compared with respect to key performance indicators. This chapter introduces simulation as an analysis tool for business process management. After describing the characteristics of business simulation models, the phases of a simulation project, the generation of random variables, and the analysis of simulation results, we discuss 15 risks, i.e., potential pitfalls jeopardizing the correctness and value of business process simulation. For example, the behavior of resources is often modeled in a rather naïve manner resulting in unreliable simulation models. Whereas traditional simulation approaches rely on hand-made models, we advocate the use of process mining techniques for creating more reliable simulation models based on real event data. Moreover, simulation can be turned into a powerful tool for operational decision making by using real-time process data. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010, 2015.",,"Administrative data processing; Benchmarking; Enterprise resource management; Analysis of simulations; Business process management; Business process simulation; Business simulation; Key performance indicators; Operational decision making; Simulation approach; Simulation projects; Risk assessment",,"Springer Berlin Heidelberg",,,,,,9783642451003; 9783642450990,,"English","Handb. on Bus.

However, based on the varying fundamental features of these two aphasia syndromes, the potentially different underlying mechanisms of impairment and scant preliminary evidence of varying cognitive deficits, a differential relationship between cognitive function and language processing in these two groups can be predicted. Aims: The current study investigates the hypothesis concerning the differential impact of cognitive impairments in individuals with fluent versus non-fluent aphasia types. Methods & Procedures: Participants with fluent (n = 19) and non-fluent (n = 16) aphasia and participants without brain damage (n = 36) were presented with an eye-tracking WM task. Additionally, individuals with aphasia completed two language comprehension tasks. Outcomes & Results: Results revealed significant decrease in WM capacity in individuals with aphasia compared with participants without brain damage. The two aphasia groups performed similarly on the WM and language tasks. Furthermore, for participants with non-fluent aphasia, it was revealed that WM makes a significant contribution to language comprehension, while for fluent individuals this relationship was not significant. Conclusions: Overall, the present data support the claim that there are cognitive deficits in aphasia and that these cognitive deficits tend to exacerbate the language impairments of persons with non-fluent aphasia types. The results are discussed in the context of varying mechanisms of impairment in different types of aphasia. The present findings have important implications both for the assessment and the treatment of individuals with aphasia and for understanding the nature of aphasia. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","fluent aphasia; language comprehension; non-fluent aphasia; working memory","adult; aged; aphasia; Article; cognitive defect; comprehension; controlled study; disease severity; eye movement; female; human; human experiment; language processing; major clinical study; male; pattern recognition; progressive nonfluent aphasia; scoring system; speech and language assessment; stimulus response; task performance; verbal behavior; visual stimulation; working memory",,"Routledge",,,,,02687038,,APHAE,"English","Aphasiology",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928694798

Name matching is a key component of systems for record linkage. Alternative spellings of the same name are a common occurrence in many applications. We use the largest collection of genealogy person records in the world together with user search query logs to build name-matching models. The procedure for building a crowd-sourced training set is outlined together with the presentation of our method. We cast the problem of learning alternative spellings as a machine translation problem at the character level. We use information retrieval evaluation methodology to show that this method substantially outperforms on our data a number of standard well known phonetic and string similarity methods in terms of precision and recall. Our result can lead to a significant practical impact in entity resolution applications. © 2014 IEEE.","Crowd Sourcing; Machine Translation; Record Linkage","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Data handling; Crowd sourcing; Entity resolutions; Machine translations; Parallel corpora; Precision and recall; Record linkage; Retrieval evaluation; String similarity; Data mining","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","14th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, ICDM 2014","14 December 2014 through 17 December 2014",,112814,15504786,,,"English","Proc.

A typical example of such a general Boolean domain, for the purpose of our results, is {1,2}n. We are mainly interested in the length (the number of monomials) of PTFs, with their degree and weight being of secondary interest. First we motivate the study of PTFs over the {1,2}n domain by showing their close relation to depth two threshold circuits. In particular we show that PTFs of polynomial length and polynomial degree compute exactly the functions computed by polynomial size THR ○ MAJ circuits. We note that known lower bounds for THR ○ MAJ circuits extend to the likely strictly stronger model of PTFs (with no degree restriction). We also show that a ""max-plus"" version of PTFs is related to AC0 ○ THR circuits. We exploit this connection to gain a better understanding of threshold circuits. In particular, we show that (super-logarithmic) lower bounds for 3-player randomized communication protocols with unbounded error would yield (super-polynomial) size lower bounds for THR ○ THR circuits. Finally, having thus motivated the model, we initiate structural studies of PTFs. These include relationships between weight and degree of PTFs, and a degree lower bound for PTFs of constant length. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Next, we find the leading term of asymptotics of the implied volatility in the case where the asset prices follow the multidimensional Black-Scholes model with time change by an independent increasing stochastic process. Finally, we deal with a general situation in which the dependence between the assets is described by a given copula function.

Often, this is achieved by computing a correlation between behavioral measures, e.g., reaction times, and neurophysiological recordings, e.g., prestimulus EEG alpha-power, on a single-trial-basis. This approach treats individual trials as independent measurements and ignores the fact that data are acquired in a temporal order. It has already been shown that behavioral measures as well as neurophysiological recordings display power-law dynamics, which implies that trials are not in fact independent. Critically, computing the correlation coefficient between two measures exhibiting long-range temporal dependencies may introduce spurious correlations, thus leading to erroneous conclusions about the relationship between brain activity and behavioral measures. Here, we address data-analytic pitfalls which may arise when long-range temporal dependencies in neural as well as behavioral measures are ignored. We quantify the influence of temporal dependencies of neural and behavioral measures on the observed correlations through simulations. Results are further supported in analysis of real EEG data recorded in a simple reaction time task, where the aim is to predict the latency of responses on the basis of prestimulus alpha oscillations. We show that it is possible to ""predict"" reaction times from one subject on the basis of EEG activity recorded in another subject simply owing to the fact that both measures display power-law dynamics. The same is true when correlating EEG activity obtained from different subjects. A surrogate-data procedure is described which correctly tests for the presence of correlation while controlling for the effect of power-law dynamics.

The method allows to assess the dynamics of reading literacy among individuals and groups of school students. The paper presents data from three samples of school students who answered the Push-Pull questions twice in one or two years. All the samples reveal the same regular patterns: considerable progress in literacy among those who scored low the first time, and regress among those who initially performed the best. Besides, great differences were found between the best performers of the test in Russia and their counterparts in the OECD countries, which means regress among the best reading students has nothing to do with the processes of age-related development. Instead, it is explained through the culture-specific development tools and the lack of teaching methods required to ensure further expansion of the reading elite.","Age-related differences; Dynamics of reading literacy; Informational texts; International comparative studies; Middle school",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

In case when the manifold N is a sphere the answer was given by A. Haefliger in 1966. In case when the manifold N is a disjoint union of spheres the answer was given by D. Crowley, S. Ferry and the author in 2011. We consider the next natural case when N is a product of two spheres. In the following theorem, FCS(i, j) ⊂ ℤ2 is a specific set depending only on the parity of i and j which is defined in the paper. Theorem. Assume that m > 2p + q + 2 and m < p + 3q/2 + 2. Then the set of isotopy classes of C1-smooth embeddings Sp × Sq → Sm is infinite if and only if either q + 1 or p + q + 1 is divisible by 4, or there exists a point (x, y) in the set FCS(m - p - q, m - q) such that (m - p - q - 2)x + (m - q - 2)y = m - 3. Our approach is based on a group structure on the set of embeddings and a new exact sequence, which in some sense reduces the classification of embeddings Sp × Sq → Sm to the classification of embeddings Sp+q {square cup} Sq → Sm and Dp × Sq → Sm. The latter classification problems are reduced to homotopy ones, which are solved rationally. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.","embedding; isotopy; knot; knotted torus; Smooth manifold; surgery",,,"World Scientific Publishing Co.

An assessment tool (SAM-Math) was developed to capture a hypothesized hierarchical structure of mathematical knowledge consisting of procedural, conceptual, and functional levels. In Study 1, SAM-Math was administered to 4th-grade students (N = 2,216). The results of Rasch analysis indicated that the test provided an operational definition for the construct of mathematical competence that included the three levels of mastery corresponding to the theoretically based hierarchy of knowledge. In Study 2, SAM-Math was administered to students in 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th grades (N = 396) to examine developmental changes in the levels of mathematics knowledge. The results showed that the mastery of mathematical concepts presented in elementary school continued to deepen beyond elementary school, as evidenced by a significant growth in conceptual and functional levels of knowledge.

Data from the Nobeyama Radioheliograph and the Siberian Solar Radio Telescope together with observations by the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) have allowed us to identify long-lived intersunspot sources (ISSs) in most of the investigated active regions. Their centers are often located above the line-of-sight magnetic field inversion line that separates the leading and following polarities of a full active region (first type of ISS) or above the inversion line that separates magnetic polarities inside of a complex of sunspots (second type of ISS). ISSs of the first type are extended and, in general, they are sources of bremsstrahlung emission. ISSs of the second type are compact and are, most likely, sources of gyroresonance or gyrosynchrotron emission.

One answer arose from the G20’s third summit, when it proclaimed the G20 would govern global finance and economics, while the old G8 would focus on development and security. Yet this rough division of labour did not address which issues lay within each category and how interconnections would be addressed to create comprehensive, coherent global governance for a complex world. This volume considers these questions. It explores the summits’ performance, the division of labour during their coexistence, their comparative strengths and limitations, and how the future partnership could be improved to benefit the global community. The authors explain the recent evolution and performance of the G8 and G20 summits and their evolving empirical relationship. They consider the G8/G20 relationship with other actors engaged in global governance, notably the major multilateral organizations and civil society. They assess G7/8 and G20 effectiveness and accountability.

According to the syntactic-oriented strategy, while processing the questions like Kto devochku potseloval v shkole? (who-NOM girl-ACC kissed at school?), activation of the object referent devochka at the verb would signal a post-verbal trace of wh-movement. Alternatively, if the processing is context-dependent, the overt object devochka preceding the verb precludes the possibility that it could be the referent of the whfiller, and the reactivation of the subject NP referent should follow instead. Indeed, the results show that the proportion of fixations on the object NP referent at the verb was less than on the subject NP referent. Therefore identification of the referent associated with the wh-filler is not syntactically constrained, but instead is contextually fed: as soon as the context provides enough cues to exclude referents that cannot be linked to the wh-filler, the remaining referent gets associated with it.","Eye-tracking; Syntactic trace; Wh-questions",,,"Izdatel'stvo Nauka",,,,,0373658X,,,"Russian","Vopr.

We say that a model admits optimal arbitrage if it is possible, in a zero-interest rate setting, starting with an initial wealth of 1 and using only positive portfolios, to superreplicate a constant c > 1. The optimal arbitrage strategy is the strategy for which this constant has the highest possible value. Our definition of optimal arbitrage is similar to that in [D. Fernholz and I. Karatzas, Ann. Appl. Probab., 20 (2010), pp. 1179-1204], where optimal relative arbitrage with respect to the market portfolio is studied. In this work we present a systematic method to construct market models where the optimal arbitrage strategy exists and is known explicitly. We then develop several new examples of market models with arbitrage, which are based on economic agents' views concerning the impossibility of certain events rather than ad hoc constructions. We also explore the robustness of arbitrage strategies with respect to small perturbations of the price process and provide new examples of arbitrage models which are robust in this sense. © 2015 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.","Incomplete markets; No unbounded profits with bounded risk; Optimal arbitrage; Robustness of arbitrage; Strict local martingales",,,"Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Publications",,,,,1945497X,,,"English","SIAM J.

However, the acculturation expectations have received relatively less attention from researchers, and support for multiculturalism has rarely been examined from the perspective of immigrants. The present study used the framework of the Mutual Intercultural Relations in Plural Societies (MIRIPS) project to investigate the acculturation experiences and intercultural relations in Hong Kong by incorporating mutual views of both the dominant and non-dominant groups. It also tested the mediating role of the dominant group's tolerance towards different cultural groups and the non-dominant group's perceived discrimination. Two community samples were recruited, including Hong Kong residents (N=181) and immigrants from Mainland China (N=182). Among Mainland immigrants, the integration strategy predicted both psychological adaptation and sociocultural adaptation. Multicultural ideology predicted psychological adaptation and played a significant role in intercultural contact with Hong Kong people through the mediation of lower perceived discrimination. Among Hong Kong residents, the integration expectation predicted psychological adaptation. Multicultural ideology indirectly affected intercultural contact with Mainland immigrants through the mediation of greater tolerance. These results suggest that the integration strategy and expectation are more important to intrapersonal functioning, whereas multicultural ideology may be more crucial in facilitating social interactions between members of the society of settlement and immigrants in culturally plural milieus. Future research should test the proposed models of dominant and non-dominant groups in other cultures. © 2015.","Acculturation; Adaptation; Integration; Intercultural contact; Multiculturalism",,,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,01471767,,,"English","Int.

Gener-alizing a result known to be valid under the assumption of complete positivity, we provide a characterization of these Gaussian-to-Gaussian (not necessarily positive) superoperators in terms of their action on the characteristic function of the inputs. For the special case of one-mode mappings, we also show that any Gaussian-to-Gaussian superoperator can be expressed as a concatenation of a phase-space dilatation, followed by the action of a completely positive Gaussian channel, possibly composed with a transposition. While a similar decomposition is shown to fail in the multi-mode scenario, we prove that it still holds at least under the further hypoth-esis of homogeneous action on the covariance matrix. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.",,,,"American Institute of Physics Inc.",,,,,00222488,,,"English","J.

Injection-thermal treatment (ITT) of MIS structures consisted of high-field electron injection into gate dielectric with the charge of defined value and subsequent parameter stabilization of MIS structures by means of thermal annealing. The MIS structures have been studied using novel techniques of multilevel current stress. Our study shows that the ITT can improve reliability of MIS structures (increase of charge-to-breakdown value) and identify defective structures. The ITT provides structural modification of SiO2 and Si-SiO2 interfaces. It has been shown that the ITT at elevated temperatures can reduce the reliability of MIS devices. Performing ITT at high temperatures leads to decrease of charge-to-breakdown average value in MIS structures. It has been demonstrated that irradiation treatment allows to reduce density of defects in thermal SiO2 films, SiO2 films doped with phosphorus, oxynitride films and as a result to increase reliability of MIS devices. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Apart from conventional clustering techniques, biclustering is searching for homogeneous groups of objects while keeping their common description, e.g., in binary setting, their shared attributes. In bioinformatics, biclustering is used to find genes, which are active in a subset of situations, thus being candidates for biomarkers. However, the authors of those biclustering techniques that are popular in gene expression analysis, may overlook the existing methods. For instance, BiMax algorithm is aimed at finding biclusters, which are well-known for decades as formal concepts. Moreover, even if bioinformatics classify the biclustering methods according to reasonable domain-driven criteria, their classification taxonomies may be different from survey to survey and not full as well. So, in this paper we propose to use concept lattices as a tool for taxonomy building (in the biclustering domain) and attribute exploration as means for cross-domain taxonomy completion.

The potential for heterosexual spread has not been analysed. Methods: A sample of PWID was accrued using two methods. A questionnaire was administered to assess HIV-related risk behaviours for parenteral and sexual transmission, sociodemographic factors, HIV knowledge and attitudes about sexual risks. Data were analysed focusing on the role of imprisonment, factors associated with awareness of being HIV infected and condom use. Results: More than a quarter of the sample reported having been diagnosed with HIV infection, with higher prevalence among women and those with a history of incarceration. More than half reported having been diagnosed with hepatitis C virus infection. Those reporting being HIV positive were less likely to distribute used syringes to other PWID and more likely to have used a condom the last time they had sex. A history of incarceration was associated with higher rates of receptive syringe sharing among those not having ever received an HIV-positive diagnosis and a lower likelihood of believing that condoms are needed when having sex with a casual partner. Conclusion: Although extensive HIV testing has alerted many PWID to their HIV-positive status, which is associated with less distributive syringe sharing and higher likelihood of condom use, substantial risk for parenteral and especially sexual HIV transmission remains. More active prevention programs will be required to control the heterosexual spread of HIV. © The Author 2015.",,"adult; age; attitude to health; comorbidity; condom; female; high risk behavior; HIV Infections; human; male; middle aged; needle sharing; prisoner; psychology; risk factor; sex difference; sexual behavior; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; substance abuse; transmission; utilization; young adult; Adult; Age Factors; Comorbidity; Condoms; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Needle Sharing; Prisoners; Risk Factors; Risk-Taking; Sex Factors; Sexual Behavior; Socioeconomic Factors; Substance Abuse, Intravenous; Young Adult",,"Oxford University Press",,,,,11011262,,EJPHF,"English","Eur.

It may be effectively realized when the main part of lithium ions are involved in the closed circuit of migration between plasma and PFE surface. Such an approach may be implemented with the use of lithium device whose hot (500-600 °C) area to be effected by plasma serves as a Li-emitter and the cold part (∼180 °C) as a Li-collector in the shadow. Capillary-pore system (CPS) provides the returning of collected and condensed lithium to emitting zone by capillary forces.

Traditional multi-field classification approaches, in both software and ternary content-addressable memory (TCAMs), entail tradeoffs between (memory) space and (lookup) time. TCAMs cannot efficiently represent range rules, a common class of classification rules confining values of packet fields to given ranges. The exponential space growth of TCAM entries relative to the number of fields is exacerbated when multiple fields contain ranges. In this work, we present a novel approach which identifies properties of many classifiers which can be implemented in linear space and with worst-case guaranteed logarithmic time and allows the addition of more fields including range constraints without impacting space and time complexities. On real-life classifiers from Cisco Systems and additional classifiers from ClassBench [7] (with real parameters), 90-95% of rules are thus handled, and the other 5- 10% of rules can be stored in TCAM to be processed in parallel.

This article fills this gap, analyzing which conditions create out-group trust independent from in-group trust. Using data from 76 countries around the world, we establish three insights. First, while a high level of in-group trust is the rule, out-group trust varies greatly across countries. Second, out-group trust emerges independent from in-group trust when human empowerment emancipates people from in-group control. Third, other conditions championed as trust-crediting forces do not confound the effect of human empowerment. In conclusion, trust generalizes to out-groups as a result of human empowerment’s emancipatory impulse. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","emancipation; empowerment; social capital; trust",,,"SAGE Publications Inc.",,,,,00220221,,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach: The study was done in a probability sample of 800 community-dwelling adults aged 16 and over in six most deprived areas of the Redbridge borough of London. Using face-to-face interviews, information on the demographics, lifestyle, Internet access at home, happiness, trait hope, and subjective health was obtained. Path analysis and structural equation modelling were used to investigate the associations between Internet access and well-being, controlling for demographic variables. Findings: Respondents with home Internet access had stronger social ties with friends and relatives, engaged in a wider repertoire of community creative activities and cultural events, and reported having higher social support. Controlling for demographic variables, Internet access at home was a weak but statistically significant predictor of happiness, agency, and absence of mental health problems. The effect of home Internet access on happiness was partially mediated by social ties. Research limitations/implications: The correlational nature of the study forbids making causal inferences. The data suggest that people with low socioeconomic status may derive wellbeing benefits from having access to information technology which can serve as an instrument for social integration. Originality/value: The data provide a demographic snapshot of the digital divide in one of the most deprived areas of London. © Boniwell et al.; Licensee Bentham Open.","Digital divide; Happiness; Internet access; Low socioeconomic status; Subjective health; Subjective well-being",,,"Bentham Science Publishers B.V.",,,,,18743501,,,"English","Open Psychol.

Despite this fact, managerial fixation on short term performance objectives, their penchant fear of the unpredictable future and their sheer inability to face the alternative futures generated in the scenario planning exercises has led to little value capture from this activity. The paper analyzes the factors that determine the willingness of decision-makers, to be actively involved in scenario planning. The authors suggest that effective incentives to promote the interest in this activity and its impact can be found, if we consider the decision-makers, as 'consumers' of certain ideas, concepts, expectations, and competencies. In particular, the paper hypothesizes and validates the assumptions that the selection of appropriate targets for scenario planning, commitment to achieving them, expectations of positive outcomes, increasing the frequency of scenario planning exercises are more likely to be expressed in the growing interest of managers and stakeholders to develop scenarios. The presented results are tested on the most common - intuitive logic approach to scenario planning. The authors expect future research to go further to empirically test the proposed hypotheses, and if possible, ascertain whether similar hypotheses could be generated in the context of other tried and tested scenario planning methodologies such as the probabilistic modified trends, competitive intelligence and cross impact analysis.","Conceptual consumption; Intuitive logics methodology; Scenario planning; Strategic foresight",,,,,,,,23129972,,,"English","Foresight STI Gov.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84953320726

They tend to believe that Russia is prone to producing unique forms of political organization. Many Russians feel flattered and readily accept their exceptionalism. Does this mentally exaggerated uniqueness of Russia have any actual affirmation? Any country in fact has a peculiar constitution of its body politic and national psyche as well as a history of its own. Many are so irregular from a common perspective that they may rightfully claim uniqueness. Russia may be a proper example of being very uncommon. But even actual inimitability cannot deprive a country of essential properties of its kind. Thus, any polity would have a power structure, albeit a very peculiar one. Any state would have individual members, be they citizens or subjects, or qualify to any other uncommon criteria of membership. With all it exceptional appearance, Russia is a constituent of the global community of states, in many ways a fairly sound and reliable one. At present, members of this community resort to polar models of relations between people and state authorities. One implies one-way subordination of people to authority, another interaction between them including accountability of authorities. Of course, in any polity, one can find institutions and practices of subordination as well as institutions and practices of interaction and accountability. The question is, Which are dominant and shape political order? The ones where subordination still prevails are less modern and more autocratic. The ones where interaction and accountability already have an advantage are more modern and democratic. In many cases, we can see uneasy processes of subordination being gradually reduced and supplanted by accountability coming to the fore. © Adam Przeworski 2015.",,,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9781107282070; 9781107053397,,"English","Democracy in a Russian Mirror",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952673886

Methods: Trends in mortality, alcohol production and sales were analyzed in conjunction with alcohol control legislative measures. Correlation analysis of health and alcohol market indicators was performed. Results: Ethyl alcohol production was the strongest correlate of alcohol-related mortality, which is probably due to the fact that ethyl alcohol is used for both recorded and unrecorded alcohol production. Measures producing greatest mortality reduction effect included provisions which reduced ethyl alcohol production (introduction of minimum authorized capital for ethyl alcohol and liquor producers in 2006 and the requirement for distillery dreg processing), as well as measures to tax and denaturize ethanol-containing liquids in 2006. Liquor tax decrease in real terms was associated with rising mortality in 1998-1999, while excise tax increasewas associated with mortality reduction in 2004 and since 2012. Conventional alcohol control measures may also have played a moderately positive role. Conclusions: Countries with high alcohol-related mortality should aim for a reduction in spirits consumption as a major health policy. Alcohol market centralization and reduction of the number of producers can have immediate strong effects on mortality. These measures should be combined with an increase in alcohol taxes and prices, as well as other established alcohol policy measures. In 2015 in Russia, this is not being implemented. In Russia, legislation enforcement including excise tax collection remains the major challenge. Another challenge will be the integration into the Eurasian Economic Union. © The Author 2015.

The GFE research programme has demonstrated the utility of applying the concept of ‘anomia’ – an individual reaction to disruptions in the normative order – to explain prejudices against vulnerable groups. This paper extends the GFE research programme by incorporating insights from Institutional Anomie Theory, a theoretical perspective originally introduced in the criminological literature. Drawing upon this, it develops a theoretical model that links perceptions of weakened non-economic institutions with prejudices against groups that are readily seen as being ‘unprofitable’. These perceptions are theorized to affect prejudices against such groups via a pathway of ‘marketized’ attitudes and orientations, net of any influence of anomia. This paper’s theoretical model was assessed with data from a representative survey of the German population (n = 840). The results of Structural Equation Modelling support most of the main hypotheses, revealing the additional value for prejudice research of measuring the individual experience of anomie not only as anomia but also with respect to processes of marketization. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Anomie; Germany; marketization; prejudices; Structural Equation Modelling",,,"SAGE Publications Ltd",,,,,00016993,,,"English","Acta Sociol.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939237933

This technique allows to monitor charge trapping in gate dielectric of MIS structures under high-field and another stress situations (irradiation, plasma, hot carriers, etc.). The technique also may be used for testing thin gate dielectric defects. Unlike simple techniques, for example constant current stress and J-ramp current stress, the proposed method uses a sequence of stress current and measuring current pulses. At the same time, the processes of charging and discharging of the MIS structure capacitance as well as the charge trapping in the gate dielectric are taken into account. Charging of MIS structure from inversion to accumulation modes or back way allows one to retrieve a low frequency capacitive-voltage characteristic. Account charging capacitance of MIS structure and charge trapping in gate dielectric at injective mode lets considerably increase metrological characteristics of this technique and reduce inaccuracies. The models describing the change in the charge state of MIS structures, both in the charge capacity, and in the mode of injection of charge carriers were developed.

The authors describe difficulties impeding the formation of a positive emotional state and spiritual comfort, dependence of happiness on the age and level of education, social status and employment, material well-being and physical health. This paper argues that despite the variety of ways and means to find a happy life, as well as individual subjectivity of happiness, the state of happiness can be long-lasting and durable only if based on economic foundation that provides a decent, or, at least, more or less acceptable level of well-being. With the improvement of living standards to the fore increasingly go intangible circumstances that help people feel happy.

In the realm of neuropsychology, research has investigated the inter-dependence of language and thought by testing individuals with compromised language abilities and observing whether performance in other cognitive domains is diminished. One group of such individuals is patients with aphasia who have an impairment in speech and language arising from a brain injury, such as a stroke. Our previous research has shown that the degree of language impairment in these individuals is strongly associated with the degree of impairment on complex reasoning tasks, such as the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) and Raven's Matrices. In the current study, we present new data from a large group of individuals with aphasia that show a dissociation in performance between putatively non-verbal tasks on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) that require differing degrees of reasoning (Picture Completion vs. Picture Arrangement tasks). We also present an update and replication of our previous findings with the WCST showing that individuals with the most profound core language deficits (i.e., impaired comprehension and disordered language output) are particularly impaired on problem-solving tasks. In the second part of the paper, we present findings from a neurologically intact individual known as ""Chelsea"" who was not exposed to language due to an unaddressed hearing loss that was present since birth. At the age of 32, she was fitted with hearing aids and exposed to spoken and signed language for the first time, but she was only able to acquire a limited language capacity. Chelsea was tested on a series of standardized neuropsychological measures, including reasoning and problem-solving tasks. She was able to perform well on a number of visuospatial tasks but was disproportionately impaired on tasks that required reasoning, such as Raven's Matrices and the WAIS Picture Arrangement task. Together, these findings suggest that language supports complex reasoning, possibly due to the facilitative role of verbal working memory and inner speech in higher mental processes. © 2015 Baldo, Paulraj, Curran and Dronkers.","Aphasia; Deafness; Inner speech; Language; Language delay; Problem-solving; Reasoning; Thought",,,"Frontiers Research Foundation",,,,,16641078,,,"English","Front.

Traditionally a two-step procedure is used. The first step is a transition from sensor to source space by the means of solving an ill-posed inverse problem for each subject individually. The second is mapping of cortical regions consis- tently active across subjects. In practice the first step often leads to a set of active cortical regions whose location and timecourses display a great amount of interindividual variability hindering the subsequent group analysis. We propose Group Analysis Leads to Accuracy (GALA) - a solution that combines the two steps into one. GALA takes advantage of individual variations of cortical geometry and sensor locations. It exploits the ensuing variability in electromagnetic forward model as a source of additional information. We assume that for different subjects functionally identical cortical regions are located in close proximity and partially overlap and their timecourses are correlated. This relaxed similarity constraint on the inverse solution can be expressed within a probabilistic framework, allowing for an iterative algorithm solving the inverse problem jointly for all subjects. A systematic simulation study showed that GALA, as compared with the standard min-norm approach, improves accuracy of true activity recovery, when accuracy is assessed both in terms of spatial proximity of the estimated and true activations and correct specification of spatial extent of the activated regions. This improvement obtained without using any noise normalization techniques for both solutions, preserved for a wide range of between-subject variations in both spatial and temporal features of regional activation. The correspond- ing activation timecourses exhibit significantly higher similarity across subjects. Similar results were obtained for a real MEG dataset of face-specific evoked responses. © 2015 Kozunov and Ossadtchi.","Covariance model; Group analysis; Inverse problem; Iterations; Maximum likelihood; MEG; Rank of leadfield matrix","algorithm; Article; brain cortex; brain region; electromagnetic field; exploratory research; fusiform face area; group analysis lead to accuracy; human; intermethod comparison; kernel method; magnetoencephalography; occipital cortex; simulation; spatial analysis; statistical analysis; statistical model; time series analysis",,"Frontiers Research Foundation",,,,,16624548,,,"English","Front.

We evaluate the legislation's impact nationally and by province for the years before and after the law's adoption. Observing that the law's effect varied substantially across provinces, we estimate the effects of the law, controlling for time, development level, export intensity, and migrant labor share, on the volume of disputes by province using a cross-sectional time series design. We also examine the law's impact on the incidence of collective disputes and the grounds for disputes.

In future, these developments could radically transform the oil, gas, and electricity markets. Therefore there is a greater need for improved forecasting methods that take into account the dynamics of market factors, primarily those related to the use of new technologies. We analyse the difficulties of forecasting demand for liquid fuels in conditions of uncertainty related to future technological developments in car transport. We classify the technologies driving demand for motor fuels by the nature of their impact on the demand for petroleum products: technologies aimed at improving the energy efficiency of traditional cars, as well as drivers of inter-fuel competition, both in terms of direct and indirect substitutes for petroleum products. To resolve the problem of limited input information, the methodology incorporates clustering instruments, which enable us to group countries according to certain criteria. The use of economic and mathematical tools with optimizing units enables us to make integrated calculations that model the market for liquid fuels and assess its interactions with the markets of other energy resources. Our proposed system for forecasting demand for liquid fuels, including petroleum products, can be used as an instrument to assess the future impact of technological innovation on the development of the oil industry when carrying out Foresight studies.","Alternative fuel; Automotive transport; Energy efficiency; Forecast of demand; Oil products; Technology",,,,,,,,23129972,,,"English","Foresight STI Gov.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84953310163

Specifically, it looks at the composite structure of time needed for participation in a time-efficient fitness programme and how different time components affect satisfaction with health, leisure time, fitness, body and look. This quasi-experimental study consisted of three stages: (i) physical entry test and pre-survey, (ii) training intervention (30 min; performed twice a week over a 4-week period) and (iii) exit test and post-survey. A total of N = 10 481 individuals participated across 316 German fitness centres. Regression results show that total time spent significantly increases satisfaction with health and fitness. Time spent on approach and parking reduces satisfaction with leisure time, while time spent on wellness and showering increases it. Spending time in the bistro increases satisfaction with health and fitness. Time spent on the actual fitness training has no significant effect on either satisfaction measure. The findings indicate that it is important to consider the composite structure of time needed for physical activity because other activities matter more than the actual time spent on exercising.

Performance measuring governance in terms of the modern state is centres on establishing the contentment of the customers purchasing these goods. This means the public servants need special professional skills for this aim: A personal performance management based on professional growth and focused on the main mission of the government–social support in mind of fulfilling civil clients’ needs. We would like to identify the degree of personal support for this conception. The research was carried out in December 2014 in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Russia. In regard to sampling procedure, we utilised a quota sampling with a representative age and gender distribution. We selected 303 participants, all of whom in the position of public servants of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The research method adopted was a questionnaire; data processing was carried out using SPSS. The results of the research show that public servants are still guided by old skills and requirements. Moreover, they are dedicated to the classical and old-fashioned conception of rational bureaucracy, based on M. Weber’s principles, namely administrative efficiency, power hierarchy, formally established and clearly documented system of rules, and impersonal activity and emotional neutrality relations. Thus, most public servants consider their main goal as governance (28.2%). They describe their job as the performance of the state (42%), administration (17%) and execution of orders (17%). However, staff at the age of 30 years (35%) more frequently chooses the satisfaction of client needs and the delivery of public goods as the main goals of authorities.

After reviewing the key ideas and schools of urban and urbanization studies, the authors examine the conceptual diversity and many-sided nature of deurbanization as a spatial, societal and cultural-mental transformation. The controversial discourse of the latter, which often implies opposite approaches and phenomena, such as social lifting or downshifting, is stressed, along with the greater role of individual decisions. Stronger social and spatial links between cities and rural areas in the globalizing world manifest themselves in the accelerated formation of the rural-urban continuum and through the growing recurrent spatial mobility of people. Russia's incomplete urbanization and polarization of its socio-economic space have created two massive opposite flows, i.e. the centrifugal seasonal dacha deurbanization and the centripetal labor migration of Russian villagers and small town dwellers towards large cities. The two streams are interrelated, e.g. temporal urban work, and the lodging of Russian otkhodniks instead of resettling, leading to the prolongation of the life of peripheral localities where their families stay. This habitability, in turn, facilitates the dacha development of small settlements. The article considers the reasons for ""guest work"" in Russian cities and the variety of dachas, as well as their impact on both urban and rural lifestyles. Mass movements of vacationers and workers and their two-house lives, sometimes balanced in time, complicates the knowledge of how many people actually live and work in the countryside, in small and big cities. This is a serious obstacle to the adequate maintenance and development of Russia's spaces, since local budgets are designed for permanent population alone - which in many places is partially true. © 2015 r.","Deurbanization; Downshifting; Labor migration; Otkhodniks; Rural-urban continuum; Seasonal dacha deurbanization; Spatial mobility; Urbanization",,,"Russian Academy of Sciences",,,,,01321625,,,"Russian","Sotsiologicheskie Issled.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962578245

The approach is based on the numerical decomposition of the free energy profiles of the transmembrane (TM) helices into components corresponding to protein-protein, protein-lipid, and protein-water interactions. The method was tested for the TM segments of human glycophorin A (GpA) and two mutant forms, Gly83Ala and Thr87Val. It was shown that lipids make a significant negative contribution to the free energy of dimerization, while amino acid residues forming the interface of the helix-helix contact may be unfavorable in terms of free energy. The detailed balance between different energy contributions is highly dependent on the amino acid sequence of the TM protein segment. The results show the dominant role of the environment in the interaction of membrane proteins that is changing our notion of the driving force behind the spontaneous association of TM α-helices. Adequate estimation of the contribution of the water-lipid environment thus becomes an extremely urgent task for a rational design of new molecules targeting bitopic membrane proteins, including receptor tyrosine kinases. © 2015 Park-media, Ltd.","Free energy of intermolecular interactions; Glycophorin A; Molecular dynamics; Protein-protein interactions; Role of the lipid membrane; Transmembrane domain",,,"Russian Federation Agency for Science and Innovation",,,,,20758251,,,"English","Acta Naturae",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951985271

Given a string of length n over an alphabet of size ω ≤ n, our method builds the wavelet tree in O(n log ω √log n) time, improving upon the state-of-the-art algorithm by a factor of √log n. As a consequence, given an array of n integers we can construct in O(n√log n) time a data structure consisting of O(n) machine words and capable of answering rank/select queries for the subranges of the array in O(log n/log log n) time. This is a log log n-factor improvement in query time compared to Chan and Pətraşcu (SODA 2010) and a √log n-factor improvement in construction time compared to Brodal et al. (Theor. Comput. Sci. 2011). Next, we switch to stringological context and propose a novel notion of wavelet suffix trees. For a string w of length n, this data structure occupies O(n) words, takes O (n√log n) time to construct, and simultaneously captures the combinatorial structure of substrings of w while enabling efficient top-down traversal and binary search. In particular, with a wavelet suffix tree we are able to answer in O(log |x|) time the following two natural analogues of rank/select queries for suffixes of substrings: 1) For substrings x and y of w (given by their endpoints) count the number of suffixes of x that are lexicographically smaller than y; 2) For a substring x of w (given by its endpoints) and an integer fc, find the κ-th lexicographically smallest suffix of x. We further show that wavelet suffix trees allow to compute a run-length-encoded Burrows-Wheeler transform of a substring x of w (again, given by its endpoints) in O(slog|x|) time, where s denotes the length of the resulting run-length encoding. This answers a question by Cormode and Muthukrishnan (SODA 2005), who considered an analogous problem for Lempel-Ziv compression. All our algorithms, except for the construction of wavelet suffix trees, which additionally requires O(n) time in expectation, are deterministic and operate in the word RAM model.

We summarize catch data on 20 species and species groups of fishes and lamprey, as well as available abiotic data (salinity, temperature and water transparency). Water transparency gradually decreased during the 20th century being inseparable from a number of non-quantified anthropogenic factors, thus it can be used as an integral index of anthropogenic loading on the ecosystem. Because fisheries statistics were not published regularly, catch data were extracted from archives and various publications. Fishing locations, gear and target species changed over time in relation to each other, reflecting technological developments in fisheries, commercial demands for fishery products and the abundance of fish populations. Until the 18–19th centuries, fisheries took place mostly in rivers where weirs and set nets targeted sturgeon, salmon and whitefish. By the end of the 19th century, herring and smelt were the main targets of fixed nets in coastal areas. A century later, the main commercial species, herring, was harvested with pelagic trawls operating offshore in the Gulf. This evolution in fisheries, along with other anthropogenic activities, caused severe declines in diadromous species. Spawning migrations that make them easy to catch, and their high market value, make diadromous fish more vulnerable than other groups. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that catches of most diadromous species decreased with increasing transparency, which may reflect their response to anthropogenic pressure. Marine and freshwater fish suffered from anthropogenic pressure, but to a lesser extent probably because of a wider distribution and dispersal, and more capital-intensive fishing methods. Catches of marine species, except herring, significantly increased in the 1970–1980s when salinity was comparatively high. We found no correlation of fish catches with temperature. © 2014, Springer Basel.","Baltic Sea; Gulf of Finland; Historical ecology; History of fisheries","abiotic factor; abundance; anthropogenic effect; canonical analysis; catch statistics; commercial activity; fish; fishing gear; historical ecology; market conditions; migration; spatiotemporal analysis; spawning; technological development; trawling; trend analysis; twentieth century; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Baltic Sea; Gulf of Finland; Leningrad; Neva River; Russian Federation; Clupeidae; Petromyzontidae; Pisces",,"Birkhauser Verlag AG",,,,,10151621,,AQSCE,"English","Aquatic Sci.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937976136

I. Arnold in 1978. Let f: ℝ/ℤ→ℝ/ℤ Let be a (real) analytic orientation preserving circle diffeomorphism and let ω Є ℂ ℤ be a parameter with positive imaginary part. Construct a complex torus by glueing the two boundary components of the annulus{ z Є ℂ/ℤ | 0 &lt; Im(z) &lt; Im(ω) } via the map f+ω. This complex torus is isomorphic to ℂ/(ℤ + τℤ) for some appropriate τ Є ℂ/ℤ. According to Moldavskis [6], if the ordinary rotation number rot(f+ω0) is Diophantine and if ω to ω0 non tangentially to the real axis, then τ tends to rot (f+ω0). We show that the Diophantine and non tangential assumptions are unnecessary: If rot(f+ω0) is irrational, then τ tends to rot (f+ω0) as ω tends to ω0. This, together with results of N. Goncharuk [4], motivates us to introduce a new fractal set (``bubbles'') given by the limit values of \tau as \omega tends to the real axis. For the rational values of rot (f+ω0), these limits do not necessarily coincide with rot (f+ω0) and form a countable number of analytic loops in the upper half-plane. © 2015 AIMSCIENCES.","Complex tori; Diffeomorphisms of the circle; Quasiconformal maps; Rotation numbers",,,"American Institute of Mathematical Sciences",,,,,19305311,,,"English","J.

Sharp non-asymptotic oracle inequalities for the robust quadratic risk have been derived. New convergence rates for the efficient procedures have been obtained. An example of the regression with a martingale noise exhibits that the minimax robust convergence rate may be both higher or lower as compared with the minimax rate for the ""white noise"" model. The results of Monte-Carlo simulations are given. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Executing the losing contender gives the winner a chance to rule uncontested for a while, but then his life is at risk if he loses to some future contender who might be, in equilibrium, too frightened to spare him. The trade-off is analyzed within a dynamic complete information game, with, potentially, an infinite number of long-term players. In an equilibrium, decisions to execute predecessors depend on the predecessors' history of executions. With a dynastic rule in place, incentives to kill the predecessor are much higher than in non-hereditary dictatorships. The historical illustration for our analysis contains a discussion of post-World War II politics of execution of deposed leaders and detailed discussion of non-hereditary military dictatorships in Venezuela in 1830-1964, which witnessed dozens of comebacks and no single political execution. © 2015.","Execution; Markov perfect equilibrium; Non-democracy; Reputation; Succession",,,"Academic Press",,,,,10909443,,,"English","Res.

K-means algorithm is suggested to be a basic one for clustering. The coordinates of the centers of clusters have been put in correspondence with summarizing time series data - the centroids of the clusters. A description of time series, the centroids of the clusters, is implemented with the use of forecasting models. They are based on strict binary trees and a modified clonal selection algorithm. With the help of such forecasting models, the possibility of forming analytic dependences is shown. It is suggested to use a common forecasting model, which is constructed for time series - the centroid of the cluster, in forecasting the private (individual) time series in the cluster.

In richer regions, higher incomes result in lower migration outflows. However, in the poorest regions, an increase in incomes results in higher emigration. This is consistent with the presence of geographical poverty traps: potential migrants want to leave the poor regions but cannot afford to move. We also show that economic growth and financial development have allowed most Russian regions to grow out of poverty traps bringing down interregional differentials of wages, incomes and unemployment rates. © 2015 Association for Comparative Economic Studies.","Labor mobility; Liquidity constraints; Poverty traps",,,"Academic Press Inc.",,,,,01475967,,,"English","J.

This paper presents the results of study of corrosion resistance in the liquid high purity lithium (con-tents of nitrogen and carbon less than 10-3% wt.) of vanadium and vanadium alloys (V-1.86Ga, V-3.4Ga-0.62Si, V-4.81Ti-4.82Cr) both non-irradiated and previously irradiated by 20 keV Ar+ ions up to dose of 1022 m-2 at the temperature of exposure 400 C. Corrosion tests were carried out in the static isothermal conditions at the temperature of 600 C during 400 hours. The corrosion behavior was evaluated by measuring weight and microhardness changes. The identity of the mechanisms of corrosion both irradiated and non-irradiated materials has been established, which consisted in the insignificant penetration of nitrogen into materials and significant oxy-gen transfer from materials into the lithium, what causes the formation of zones with reduced microhardness near the surface of samples. Traces of corrosion effect on the surface morphology of the studied materials after exposure to lithium were also found, resulting in the appearance of grain boundaries and slip lines, the latter being most clearly observed in the case of prelimanary irradiation by argon ions.","Ar+ions.; Corrosion resistance; Liquid lithium; Vanadium alloys",,,"National Research Center Kurchatov Institute",,,,,02023822,,,"Russian","Probl.

The potential of state-of-the-art process mining (data-driven process analysis) is limited by quality issues with transactional data registration and extraction. A novel approach is proposed to address these challenges: the Enterprise Operational Analysis (EOA) founded in DEMO and the Enterprise Operating System (EOS). The EOS is a software system based on enterprise engineering, and stores, interprets, and executes DEMO models as native source code. The EOS provides workflow-like capabilities and supports EOA. Combining the EOS with state-of-the-art process mining offers the following advantages: guaranteed completeness of analysis, elimination of ‘mining’ for events, facilitating process conformance checking, analysis on various levels of granularity from various perspectives. It enables enterprises to systematically analyze, improve and deploy business procedures.

The topological trigger selects vertices which are a) detached from the primary proton-proton collision and b) compatible with coming from the decay of a b-hadron. In the LHC Run 1, this trigger, which utilized a custom boosted decision tree algorithm, selected a nearly 100% pure sample of b-hadrons with a typical efficiency of 60-70%; its output was used in about 60% of LHCb papers. This talk presents studies carried out to optimize the topological trigger for LHC Run 2. In particular, we have carried out a detailed comparison of various machine learning classifier algorithms, e.g., AdaBoost, MatrixNet and neural networks. The topological trigger algorithm is designed to select all 'interesting"" decays of b-hadrons, but cannot be trained on every such decay. Studies have therefore been performed to determine how to optimize the performance of the classification algorithm on decays not used in the training. Methods studied include cascading, ensembling and blending techniques. Furthermore, novel boosting techniques have been implemented that will help reduce systematic uncertainties in Run 2 measurements. We demonstrate that the reoptimized topological trigger is expected to significantly improve on the Run 1 performance for a wide range of b-hadron decays. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Adaptive boosting; Artificial intelligence; Blending; Data mining; Decay (organic); Decision trees; Elementary particles; Hadrons; High energy physics; Learning systems; Topology; Trees (mathematics); Trigger circuits; Uncertainty analysis; B-hadron decays; Blending techniques; Boosted decision trees; Classification algorithm; Proton proton collisions; Reoptimization; Systematic uncertainties; Trigger algorithms; Algorithms","","Institute of Physics Publishing","21st International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics, CHEP 2015","13 April 2015 through 17 April 2015",,119606,17426588,,,"English","J.

In particular, GRACE temporal gravity field observations revolutionize the study of basin-scale hydrology, because gravity data reflect mass changes related to ground and surface water redistribution, ice melting, and precipitation accumulation over large scales. However, to use the GRACE data products, de-striping/filtering is required. We applied the multichannel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) technique to filter GRACE data and separate its principal components (PCs) at different periodicities. Data averaging over the 15 largest river basins of Russia was performed. Spring 2013 can be characterized by the extremely large snow accumulation occurred in Russia. Melting of this snow induced large floods and abrupt increase of river levels. The exceptional maxima are evident from GRACE observations, which can be compared to the hydrological models, such as Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) or WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM), and gauge data. Long-periodic climate-related changes were separated into PC 2. Finally, it was observed that there were mass increases in Siberia and decreases around the Caspian Sea. Overall trend over Russia demonstrates mass increase until 2009, when it had a maximum, followed by the decrease. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.","Earth’s gravity field; GRACE; Hydrological changes; MSSA","Earth (planet); Geodetic satellites; Hydrology; Microcomputers; Principal component analysis; Rivers; Snow; Spectrum analysis; Watersheds; GRACE; Gravity field; Gravity recovery and climate experiments; Hydrological changes; Land data assimilation systems; MSSA; Multichannel singular spectrum analysis; Spherical harmonic coefficient; Gravitation",,"Springer Berlin Heidelberg",,,,,,9783662450529; 9783662450512,,"English","Planet.

Their functioning determines the response of the cell to the external conditions. Also, they provide cellular communication and recognitionmechanisms. So, their proper functioning is a vital question of life. There is a lot of data today about these receptors. Many three-dimensional (3D) structures are known, genetic causes of some diseases are determined andmany therapeutic agents acting on the membrane proteins are developed. But today with all this knowledge we cannot exactly predict the effects of new mutations in these proteins on their activity and cannot decipher the mechanisms of their action in detail. On the other side, cell membrane consists of phospholipids acting as a matrix for the proteins and other molecules like glycolipids. Of course, exact lipid composition of the membrane affects the proteins behavior, but this phenomenon is reversible. Many papers describe how single-point mutations act on the protein activity, another large area of study includes determination of the influence from the lipid bilayer properties. But little is said about how the protein itself induces local perturbations on the membrane. Taking this into account, we decided to examine the simplest case of the membrane protein with a help of atomistic computer simulations of molecular dynamics. Using transmembrane (TM) helical peptide representing TMdomain of human glycophorinA in hydrated lipid bilayer, we showed that it can induce local perturbations of lipid properties, and the characteristic size of the pattern is 10-15 ÅA. So, the peptides can feel each other on large distances (about 20 Å), and this estimation is confirmed by calculation of the association free energy. We determined that the interaction interface for dimer formation also serves as a binding site for lipids. They are removed from this site during dimerization process, but stay nearby in the dimer structure filling the gaps next to the contact of helices. We assume that native sequences generate specific distributions of lipids around them to find each other in the membrane and have specific surface relief to strengthen the interaction in case of dimerizing proteins by lipid binding to the formed dimer. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We examine the roles of individual value priorities and of national laws regarding homosexuality and the interaction between them in explaining approval of homosexuality. Data are drawn from the European Social Survey and include representative national samples of 27 European countries in 2010. As hypothesized, individuals who prioritized openness to change and universalism values approved of homosexuality more, whereas those who prioritized conservation and power values exhibited more disapproval. Approval was greater in countries whose laws regarding homosexuality were more progressive. In addition, legal regulation of homosexuality moderated the associations of individual value priorities. In countries with more progressive laws, both the positive effect of openness to change values and the negative effect of conservation values on approval of homosexuality were weaker. However, the positive effect of universalism values and the negative effect of power values did not vary as a function of national laws regarding homosexuality. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",,,,,00462772,,EJSPA,"English","Eur.

When the closed subscheme is a Cartier divisor, we consider matrix factorizations of the related section of a line bundle, and their analogues with locally free sheaves replaced by coherent ones. The appropriate exotic derived category of coherent matrix factorizations is then identified with the triangulated category of relative singularities, while the similar exotic derived category of locally free matrix factorizations is its full subcategory. The latter category is identified with the kernel of the direct image functor corresponding to the closed embedding of the zero locus and acting between the conventional (absolute) triangulated categories of singularities. Similar results are obtained for matrix factorizations of infinite rank; and two different “large” versions of the triangulated category of relative singularities, corresponding to the approaches of Orlov and Krause, are identified in the case of a Cartier divisor. A version of the Thomason-Trobaugh-Neeman localization theorem is proven for coherent matrix factorizations and disproven for locally free matrix factorizations of finite rank. Contravariant (coherent) and covariant (quasicoherent) versions of the Serre-Grothendieck duality theorems for matrix factorizations are established, and pull-backs and push-forwards of matrix factorizations are discussed at length. A number of general results about derived categories of the second kind for curved differential graded modules (CDG-modules) over quasicoherent CDG-algebras are proven on the way.

A typical solution is generating only a part of all patterns satisfying some criteria. The most well-known criterion is support of a pattern, which has the monotonicity property allowing one to generate only frequent (highly supported) patterns. Many other useful criteria are not monotonic, which makes it difficult to generate best patterns efficiently. In this paper we introduce the notion of ""generalized monotonicity"" and algorithm that allow to generate top patterns in polynomial time modulo basic operations, e.g., measure computation, for criteria that are not monotonic.

Basicly, two different storage types are used to store data in the hybrid data storage systems. Keeping rarely used data on cheap and slow storages of type one and often used data on fast and expensive storages of type two helps to achieve optimal performance/cost ratio for the system. We use classification algorithms to estimate probability that the data will often used in future. Then, using the risks analysis we define where the data should be stored. We show how to estimate optimal number of replicas of the data using regression algorithms and Hidden Markov Model. Based on the probability, risks and the optimal nuber of data replicas our system finds optimal data distribution in the hybrid data storage system.

Although simple to implement and potentially useful to augment many functions, such myoelectric devices still need improvement before they become practical. Here we considered the problem of reconstruction of handwriting from multichannel EMG activity. Previously, linear regression methods (e.g., the Wiener filter) have been utilized for this purpose with some success. To improve reconstruction accuracy, we implemented the Kalman filter, which allows to fuse two information sources: the physical characteristics of handwriting and the activity of the leading hand muscles, registered by the EMG. Applying the Kalman filter, we were able to convert eight channels of EMG activity recorded from the forearm and the hand muscles into smooth reconstructions of handwritten traces. The filter operates in a causal manner and acts as a true predictor utilizing the EMGs from the past only, which makes the approach suitable for real-time operations. Our algorithm is appropriate for clinical neuroprosthetic applications and computer peripherals. Moreover, it is applicable to a broader class of tasks where predictive myoelectric control is needed. © 2015 Okorokova, Lebedev, Linderman and Ossadtchi.","Dynamical modeling; Electromyography; Handwriting; Pattern recognition; The Kalman Filter; The Wiener Filter","algorithm; Article; biomechanics; comparative study; controlled study; electrode implantation; electromyography; handwriting; human; human experiment; Kalman Filter; mathematical analysis; muscle contraction; neuromuscular function; normal human; statistical model; task performance; Wiener Filter",,"Frontiers Research Foundation",,,,,16624548,,,"English","Front.

All types of cell stress are accompanied by the activation of anti-stress genes that can suppress ROS synthesis. We hypothesized that different environmental factors would affect organisms through the activation of anti-stress genes by autologous serum (AS) proteins, followed by the synthesis of molecules that increase cell resistance to oxidative stress. The goal of this work was to study the influence of AS on ROS production by peripheral blood neutrophils isolated from donors in different age groups. Neutrophils were isolated from 59 donors (38-94 years old). AS was heated at 100°C for 30 s. or irradiated by UV light at 200-280 nm and 8 W for 10 min. Neutrophils were exposed to heat shock at 42°C for 1 min. (short-term heating stress) or 43°C for 10 min., followed by the determination of the chemiluminescence reaction induced by zymosan. AS can increase or decrease ROS production by neutrophils depending on the structure of the proteins in the serum; these structures can be changed by heating or UV treatment and the temperature of their interaction (4 or 37°C). We propose that the effect of environmental factors on AS proteins can cause an adverse increase in oxidative stress levels due to the functional reduction of anti-stress genes. We found a negative correlation between the quantity of intracellular Hsp70 and levels of intracellular ROS production following 10 min of heat shock at 43°C. Short-term heating stress (1 min) at 42°C was followed by a prominent reduction in ROS production. This effect may be a result of the impact of the hormone adrenaline on the functions of anti-stress genes. Indeed, the same effect was observed after treatment of the neutrophils with adrenaline at concentrations of 10-4 and 10-5 M. In contrast, dexamethasone from the other stress hormone group did not evoke the same effect at the same concentrations. © 2015 Semenkov, Michalski and Sapozhnikov.","Adrenaline; Autologous proteins; Dexamethasone; Heat shock proteins; Phagocytosis; Reactive oxygen species; Short-term heating stress; Ultraviolet light","adrenalin; dexamethasone; heat shock protein 70; reactive oxygen metabolite; adult; aged; Article; chemoluminescence; controlled study; female; flow cytometry; gene function; heat shock; heating; human; human cell; male; neutrophil; oxidative stress; phagocyte; serum; ultraviolet radiation; very elderly",,"Frontiers Research Foundation",,,,,16648021,,,"English","Front.

In the second stage, a single vehicle transports jobs between the two factories. In our research, both setup time and capacity constraints are explicitly considered. For the problem of minimizing the makespan, we formalize it as a mixed in-teger programming model and prove it to be strongly NP-hard. Considering the computational complexity, we develop two heuristic algorithms applied in two dierent cases of this problem. Accordingly, two lower bounds are derived, based on which the worst case performance is analyzed. Finally, dierent scales of random instances are generated to test the performance of the proposed al-gorithms. The computational results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, especially for large-scale instances.","Batching; Heuristic algorithm; Supply chain scheduling; Transportation",,,"American Institute of Mathematical Sciences",,,,,15475816,,,"English","J.

Notably, the coupling between neural oscillations at different timescales has recently received much attention, both from experimentalists and theoreticians. We review the mechanisms underlying various forms of this cross-frequency coupling. We show that different types of neural oscillators and cross-frequency interactions yield distinct signatures in neural dynamics. Finally, we associate these mechanisms with several putative functions of cross-frequency coupling, including neural representations of multiple environmental items, communication over distant areas, internal clocking of neural processes, and modulation of neural processing based on temporal predictions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Computational models; Cross-frequency coupling; Neural communication; Neural oscillations; Sequence representation; Stimulus parsing","amplitude modulation; architecture; auditory cortex; brain function; brain region; cognition; electroencephalography; frequency modulation; hippocampus; human; hypothesis; magnetoencephalography; nerve cell; neural cross frequency coupling; neurophysiology; oscillation; oscillator; prediction; priority journal; Review; speech perception; animal; biological model; brain; membrane potential; nerve cell network; physiology; Animals; Brain; Electroencephalography; Humans; Membrane Potentials; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neurons",,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,01662236,,TNSCD,"English","Trends Neurosci.",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947745913

A typical finding in Western societies is that women prefer men who are taller than themselves and, equivalently, men prefer women who are shorter than themselves. However, recent reports in non-Western societies (e.g., the Himba in Namibia) challenge the view on the universality of such preferences. Here we report on male and female height preferences in two non-Western populations--the Hadza (Tanzania) and the Tsimane' (Bolivia)--and the relationships between body height preferences and the height of actual partners. In the Hadza, most individuals preferred a sexual dimorphism in stature (SDS) with the man being much taller than the woman. Preferences for SDS and actual partner SDS were positively and significantly correlated in both men and women, suggesting that people who preferred larger height differences also had larger height differences with their partners. In the Tsimane', the majority of men preferred an SDS with the man being taller than the woman, but women did not show such a preference. Unlike in the Hadza, SDS preference was not significantly correlated to actual partner SDS. We conclude that patterns of height preferences and choices in the Hadza and Tsimane' are different than those observed in Western societies, and discuss possible causes for the observed differences between non-Western and Western societies.",,"adult; body height; body image; Bolivia; cultural anthropology; cultural psychology; decision making; female; human; male; psychology; sexual behavior; sexuality; Tanzania; Adult; Body Height; Body Image; Bolivia; Choice Behavior; Ethnopsychology; Female; Humans; Male; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Partners; Tanzania; Western World",,,,,,,14747049,,,"English","Evol Psychol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84948186791

Discussions highlighted that strengths in rural and remote communities, such as easy access to local leaders and existing partnerships, can help to further age-friendly goals; however, addressing major challenges, such as lack of infrastructure and limited availability of social and health services, requires regional or national government buy-in and funding opportunities. Age-friendly work in rural and remote communities is, therefore, ideally embedded in larger age-friendly initiatives and supported by regional or national policies, programs, and funding sources.

Recent publications use data from online social networks to detect people with depression propensity and diagnosis. In this study, we investigate the capabilities of previously published methods and metrics applied to the Russian online social network VKontakte. We gathered user profile data from most popular communities about suicide and depression on VK.com and performed comparative analysis between them and randomly sampled users. We have used not only standard user attributes like age, gender, or number of friends but also structural properties of their egocentric networks, with results similar to the study of suicide propensity in the Japanese social network Mixi.com. Our goal is to test the approach and models in this new setting and propose enhancements to the research design and analysis. We investigate the resulting classifiers to identify profile features that can indicate depression propensity of the users in order to provide tools for early depression detection.

For instance, Distance Bounding Protocols take into account the round trip time of messages and the transmission velocity to infer an upper bound of the distance between two agents. We classify such security protocols as Cyber-Physical. Time plays a key role in design and analysis of many of these protocols. This paper investigates the foundational differences and the impacts on the analysis when using models with discrete time and models with dense time. We show that there are attacks that can be found by models using dense time, but not when using discrete time. We illustrate this with a novel attack that can be carried out on most distance bounding protocols. In this attack, one exploits the execution delay of instructions during one clock cycle to convince a verifier that he is in a location different from his actual position. We propose a Multiset Rewriting model with dense time suitable for specifying cyber-physical security protocols. We introduce Circle-Configurations and show that they can be used to symbolically solve the reachability problem for our model. Finally, we show that for the important class of balanced theories the reachability problem is PSPACE-complete. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",,"Mobile security; Network security; Cyber physicals; Cyber-Physical securities; Design and analysis; Distance bounding protocols; Multiset rewriting; Reachability problem; Security protocols; Transmission velocities; Security of data","Facebook;Microsoft Research;Semmle;Springer-Verlag;Winton","Springer Verlag","4th International Conference on Principles of Security and Trust, POST 2015 held as part of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software, ETAPS 2015","11 April 2015 through 18 April 2015",,116059,03029743,9783662466650,,"English","Lect.

Our first contribution is to clarify the worst-case size of positive existential (PE), non-recursive Data log (NDL), and first-order (FO) rewritings for various classes of tree-like conjunctive queries, ranging from linear queries to bounded tree width queries. Perhaps our most surprising result is a super polynomial lower bound on the size of PE-rewritings that holds already for linear queries and ontologies of depth 2. More positively, we show that polynomial-size NDL-rewritings always exist for tree-shaped queries with a bounded number of leaves (and arbitrary ontologies), and for bounded tree width queries paired with bounded depth ontologies. For FO-rewritings, we equate the existence of polysize rewritings with well-known problems in Boolean circuit complexity. As our second contribution, we analyze the computational complexity of query answering and establish tractability results (either NL-or LOGCFL-completeness) for a range of query-ontology pairs. Combining our new results with those from the literature yields a complete picture of the succinctness and complexity landscapes for the considered classes of queries and ontologies. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Birds; Forestry; Boolean circuit; Complexity results; Conjunctive queries; Like queries; Polynomial size; Query answering; Query topology; Super-polynomials; Trees (mathematics)","ACM Special Interest Group on Logic and Computation (SIGLOG);ERATO Kawarabayashi Large Graph Project;IEEE Technical Committee on Mathematical Foundations of Computing;MEXT Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas ""Exploring the Limits of Computation"";Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences of Kyoto University;Tateisi Science and Technology Foundation","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","30th Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, LICS 2015","6 July 2015 through 10 July 2015",,115965,10436871,9781479988754,PSLSE,"English","Proc Symp Logic Comput Sci",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945914190

The microbial communities and metabolic potential in these ecosystems are largely uncharacterized. Here, we present four single amplified genomes (SAGs) obtained from 8,219mbelow the sea surface within the hadal ecosystem of the Puerto Rico Trench (PRT). These SAGs are derived from members of deep-sea clades, including the Thaumarchaeota and SAR11 clade, and two are related to previously isolated piezophilic (high-pressure-adapted) microorganisms. In order to identify genes that might play a role in adaptation to deep-sea environments, comparative analyses were performed with genomes from closely related shallow-water microbes. The archaeal SAG possesses genes associated with mixotrophy, including lipoylation and the glycine cleavage pathway. The SAR11 SAG encodes glycolytic enzymes previously reported to be missing from this abundant and cosmopolitan group. The other SAGs, which are related to piezophilic isolates, possess genes that may supplement energy demands through the oxidation of hydrogen or the reduction of nitrous oxide. We found evidence for potential trench-specific gene distributions, as several SAG genes were observed only in a PRT metagenome and not in shallower deep-sea metagenomes.

The outcome of this work is a better understanding of the relevant parameters for buffer management to achieve better performance in dynamic environments of data centers. We consider a model that captures more of the properties of the target architecture than previous work and consider several scheduling and buffer management algorithms that are specifically designed to optimize its performance.

Words are differentially represented in the brain according to their semantic category and these difficulties in ASC predict reduced activation to emotion-related words in limbic structures crucial for affective processing. Semantic theories view 'emotion actions' as critical for learning the semantic relationship between a word and the emotion it describes, such that emotion words typically activate the cortical motor systems involved in expressing emotion actions such as facial expressions. As ASC are also characterised by motor deficits and atypical brain structure and function in these regions, motor structures would also be expected to show reduced activation during emotion-semantic processing. Here we used event-related fMRI to compare passive processing of emotion words in comparison to abstract verbs and animal names in typically-developing controls and individuals with ASC. Relatively reduced brain activation in ASC for emotion words, but not matched control words, was found in motor areas and cingulate cortex specifically. The degree of activation evoked by emotion words in the motor system was also associated with the extent of autistic traits as revealed by the Autism Spectrum Quotient. We suggest that hypoactivation of motor and limbic regions for emotion word processing may underlie difficulties in processing emotional language in ASC. The role that sensorimotor systems and their connections might play in the affective and social-communication difficulties in ASC is discussed. © 2014 The Authors.

Our results showed that in all 3 patients, disruption extended to connections projecting to areas distant from the lesion.We confirmed that the damaged tracts link areas that in contemporary neuroscience are considered functionally engaged for tasks related to emotion and decision-making (Gage), language production (Leborgne), and declarative memory (Molaison). Our findings suggest that even historic cases should be reappraised within a disconnection framework whose principles were plainly established by the associationist schools in the last 2 centuries. © 2015 The Author.","Behavioral neurology; Brain lesion; Diaschisis; Disconnection syndromes; White matter","adult; aged; Article; brain cortex; brain disease; cardiac gated imaging; case report; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; declarative memory; diffusion tensor imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; disconnection syndrome; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; human tissue; male; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; white matter; brain; decision making; emotion; history; language; memory; neurology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; physiology; skull; syndrome; Brain; Decision Making; Emotions; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Language; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory; Neurology; Skull; Syndrome; White Matter",,"Oxford University Press",,,,,10473211,,CECOE,"English","Cereb.

Study 1 (N = 35,116) analyses data from representative samples in 20 countries that responded to the 21-item version of the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ-21) in the European Social Survey. Study 2 (N = 7,773) analyses data from adult samples in six of the same countries (Finland, Germany, Greece, Israel, Poland, and United Kingdom) and eight other countries (Australia, Brazil, Chile, Italy, Slovakia, Turkey, Ukraine, and United States) that completed the full 40-item PVQ. Across both studies, political activism relates positively to self-transcendence and openness to change values, especially to universalism and autonomy of thought, a subtype of self-direction. Political activism relates negatively to conservation values, especially to conformity and personal security. National differences in the strength of the associations between individual values and political activism are linked to level of democratization. © 2014 The British Psychological Society.","Cross-cultural; Participation; Political activism; Values","adult; aged; Australia; cross-sectional study; cultural factor; Europe; female; human; male; middle aged; politics; questionnaire; social behavior; social psychology; South America; United States; young adult; Adult; Aged; Australia; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Cross-Sectional Studies; Europe; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Politics; Questionnaires; Social Behavior; Social Values; South America; United States; Young Adult",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd.",,,,,00071269,,,"English","Br.

The highlights of structural equivalence assessment study are presented, showing the cross-cultural invariance of 36 items of the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI) scale. The associations between country-level ZTPI scores and other culture-level indicators, including the Human Development Index and Hofstede cultural dimensions, are presented and discussed. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, five distinct profiles of time perspective were found (future-oriented, present-oriented, balanced, moderately fatalistic, and negative), and significant differences in the prevalence of these profiles across cultures were found. Implications and perspectives for future research are discussed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,,"Springer International Publishing",,,,,,9783319073682; 9783319073675,,"English","Time Perspective Theory; Review, Research and Application: Essays in Honor of Philip G.
