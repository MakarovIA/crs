Even if we cannot solve the problem we may contribute to understand it. To this end, we have compiled the methods used in various scientific disciplines to describe benefit and built a theoretical framework for these methods. The framework includes the aims, the subject matter measured, and the risks of a measurement as well as a possible sequence for the application of the methods as part of the benefit assessment. It includes six steps. Each of these steps contributes specific information to the benefit assessment. Because it is impossible to apply all of these steps and methods under real world conditions a sensible selection has to be made on which methods to consider or disregard. We assume that this selection depends on the selected objectives and the selection of objectives depends on values such as justice or utility. Consequently we propose to address as a first step the discussion about values before objectives can be defined and appropriate tools can be selected. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.","analytical hierarchy process; benefit; conjoint analysis; meta-analysis; structural equation model; utility","article; clinical decision making; drug manufacture; goal attainment; health care survey; health care system; health care utilization; human; information; methodology; nomenclature; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk assessment; simulation; structural equation modeling",,,,,,,14322625,,GEQUF,"English","Gesundh.okon.

However, the currently least developed aspect of the semantic content life-cycle is the user- friendly manual and semi-automatic creation of rich semantic content. In this paper we present the RDFaCE approach for combining WYSIWYG text authoring with the creation of rich semantic annotations. Our approach is based on providing four different views to the content authors: a classical WYSIWYG view, a WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) view making the semantic annotations visible, a fact view and the respective HTML/RDFa source code view. The views are synchronized such that changes made in one of the views automatically update the others. They provide different means of semantic content authoring for the different personas involved in the content creation life-cycle. For bootstrapping the semantic annotation process we integrate five different text annotation services. We evaluate their accuracy and empirically show that a combination of them yields superior results. © 2012 IEEE.","RDFa; rNews; Semantic content authoring; Text annotation","Content creation; RDFa; rNews; Semantic annotations; Semantic content; Semi-automatics; Source codes; Text annotations; Text authoring; Web of datum; WYSIWYG; Life cycle; Semantics","IEEE;IEEE Computer Society",,"36th IEEE Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference, COMPSAC 2012","16 July 2012 through 20 July 2012","Izmir",94244,07303157,9780769547367,PSICD,"English","Proc Int Comput Software Appl Conf",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871168944

Recognizing the need to point economic development towards innovation, the government has undertaken institutional reform. This paper assesses the evolution of science, technology and innovation policy for the last decade in Vietnam, with emphasis on the coherence and efficiency of policy instruments. The study shows that despite major steps forward in the formation of a legislative and institutional framework for the national innovation system, there are factors working against it. The mixed character of the Vietnamese economy (combining market institutions with tight public regulation and a significant share of public property) fostered by inconsistent and ineffective policies, discourages the innovation environment and synergy of reforms. There is also a huge gap between policy and implementation. Another factor is difficulties with setting strategic goals and defining policy priorities: policy tasks are overwhelming in number, but also there is overlap. There is no interdepartmental agency able to provide horizontal and vertical co-ordination of governmental initiatives. The bias towards fostering «technology push» as well as preserving dominance of state actors in science and industry is the most important inconsistency; «market pull» based tools remain underdeveloped. A new set of measures envisaged by the Strategy of Scientific, Technological and Innovation Development for 2011-2020 provides some opportunity for new policies. The government will need to revise the framework conditions restricting the development of competition, introduce demand-driven and inclusive development oriented tools as well as develop targeted and complementary regulation. Qualitative improvement of institutions requires introducin competitiveness where now economic elites dominate, and this, again, forces into the open the tension between economic pluralism and political monopoly.","National innovation system; Policy mix; S&T and innovation policy institutes; Transitional economy; Vietnam",,,,,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886734802

Mjasnickaja 20, 101990 Moskva, Russian Federation","The article reconstructs the circumstances of of the adoption of the first artistic conventions that al - lowed Russian artists at the beginning of the nineteenth century to create their first representations of the national past. The origin of new visual symbols such as national heroes, costumes, and typical ethnic looks is dated and their semantics deciphered based on the analysis of such sources as the commissioners' notes describing the motifs to be pictured in history paintings as well as patriotic press publications and pieces of history painting and sculpture. Their reception by the public and the complications of their subsequent verbal conceptualization are presented within the context of a controversy between the publishers of two art journals of the 1820s, Paul Svin'in and Vasilii Grigorovich. The author believes that the priority given to visual language in the Russian national project had to do with the specific cultural situation of the Russian Empire, particularly at the turn of the nine - teenth century. A low literacy rate meant that Russian elites could not rely on verbal language as a tool for mobilizing support and generating imperial, ethnic, and national solidarities. That is why students of nationalism do not find convincing written evidence of a Russian national consciousness either in the eighteenth century or in the first three decades of the nineteenth. In contrast to their unsuccessful efforts, the author's analysis of the visual language of describing the past detects elements of national imagination of the time at issue. The author defines the 1830s as a turning point in the evolution of Russian ways to see the national past: the convention between the artists and their audience changed, resulting in a substitution of document-based symbols for symbolic representations of the Russian past. This revision of convention antiquated the early nineteenth century history paintings, and rendered the signs of the national employed in them incomprehensible.",,,,,,,,,00214019,,,"English","Jahrb.

It provides an overview of the dynamics of main indicators of scientific publications and their citation in Russia and leading countries over the period 1995-2010. Based on this analysis, the author estimates Russia's position within the global scientific community. The data are drawn from Scopus and the Web of Science databases. For Russia, the focus is on publication activity in specific areas of science, identified as specializations. In particular, the level of citation of the most highly Russian publications is noted. Also, the paper focuses on the integration of Russianresearchers in the international scientific community, as measured by the number of publications co-authored with foreign researchers. Finally, it reviews the methodological approaches of the evaluation of citations, focusing on resulting problems which require further investigations. The analysis shows that Russia has lost more international status in scientific publishing activity than other countries of the studied sample. At thesame time the other BRIC nations as well as some other developing Asian countries have significantly improved their international positioning in this regard.","Bibliometric indicators; Cross-country analysis; Highly cited publications; Index of scientific specialization; International co-authorship; Levels of citation; Place of Russia in the global scientific community; Publication activity; Publication activity in Russia; Russian Federation; Scientific publications; Scopus; Structure of publications; Web of Science",,,,,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886542780

The concepts of networks are critically analysed and applied to explorative case studies of hotel chains operating in Russia. The chapter adds to the literature in the hospitality industry by expanding on existing theories of network strategies and illustrates their different patterns within the framework of modern hotel chains' strategies. A detailed description of the current Russian hotel market situation is presented. The main trends in the Russian hospitality sector are analyzed and key factors stimulating the development of Russian hospitality are outlined. The huge potential of the Russian hospitality sector is revealed. Among the factors impeding the future development of the market, the following are identified: the lack of a developed service standards system and the lack of developed marketing policies and strategies (i.e. inefficient pricing, sales, and communication policy; lag in modern technologies). The formation of domestic and international hotel chains in this environment is described. © 2012, IGI Global.",,,,"IGI Global",,,,,,9781466600775,,"English","Service Science Res., Strategy and Innovation: Dyn.

However the impact of such studies on the performance of the national innovation system remains unclear. The paper therefore assesses the impact of national Foresight studies conducted in member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the European Research Area (ERA).The study provides a first indication of the impact of national Foresight studies on the performance of national innovation systems. However the findings so far are preliminary since input data reflect long term developments of national innovation systems. Thus a long term study of the impacts of national Foresight studies is essential. In the short term, it can be concluded that national Foresight studies contribute significantly to the design and in some countries reshape of the innovation system structure and framework conditions. A direct quantitative measurement of the impact and thus the value of Foresight studies cannot yet be done in a statistically reliable fashion. However the changes these studies have caused within the national innovation systems may have an indirect impact on the future national innovation performance. Most recently national Foresight studies have switched from a rather exclusive focus on technology trend assessments towards more integrated holistic approaches identifying future challenges for society and economy as a whole thus deriving strengths and weaknesses of the national scientific, research and technology base to meet these challenges long term in the most appropriate way. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,"future prospect; holistic approach; innovation; performance assessment; socioeconomic impact; technological development; trend analysis",,,,,,,00163287,,,"English","Futures",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870064079

In our research we outlined a number of methods for developing time competence and various conscious and unconscious ways to organize time and to create an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, and trust in interpersonal nonverbal communication. The time characteristics of social behavior and its nonverbal manifestation can exert a positive influence on communicative activity and can determine time competence in communication. Ignoring time parameters in the self-realization and self-actualization of personality introduces a certain destructive element into the process of interpersonal relations; hence the necessity of teaching competence in communication arises. Teaching is carried out in the process of training and includes several stages: the introductory stage and the stages of intensification, integration, avoidance, and others.

We employ two alternative measures for this fear. The first one looks at the workers’ fear of losing their current jobs, while the second deals with the fear of not finding relevant re-employment in case of displacement. In order to get the best possible measurement of unemployment for those local and social environments where our respondents live and work, we design unemployment rates for narrowly defined regional and demographic (peer) groups. Estimating ordered probit models for both fear measures, and controlling for various worker and job characteristics, we do not find significant causal effects of unemployment on these fears in most of our specifications. These results are robust to exclusion of potentially endogenous variables; they hold for different periods, subsamples, and levels of job security. Moreover, our simulations show that even a large increase in the unemployment rate has little impact on conditional probabilities of expressing a strong or weak fear of unemployment. These results suggest that the high level and persistence of fear of unemployment in Russia may be caused by non-economic factors.

The depth dimension is physically real and extends from the bottom micro-level to the ultimate macro-level of the Universe. The depth dimension, or the scales axis, complements the standard three spatial dimensions. I discuss the tentative qualities of the depth dimension and the universal arrangement of matter along this dimension. I suggest that all matter in the Universe, at least in the present cosmological epoch, is in joint downward motion along the depth dimension. The joint downward motion manifests itself in the universal contraction of matter. The opposite direction of motion, upward the dimension, would cause the expansion of matter. The contraction of matter is a primary factor, whereas the shrinking of space in the vicinity of matter is a derivative phenomenon. The observed expansion of the Universe is explained by the fact that celestial bodies become smaller due to matter contraction, while the overall space remains predominantly intact. Thus, relative to the contracting material bodies, the total span of cosmic space appears to be becoming vaster. I attempt to explain how the contraction of matter engenders the effect of universal gravity. I use over thirty animated and graphical color visualizations in the text to make the explanation of the proposed ideas more lucid. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cosmology; Expansion of the Universe; Extra spatial dimensions; General relativity; Nature of gravity; Nature of mass; Origins of inertia; Scales",,,,,,,,11221151,,,"English","Axiomathes",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870381545

In this case the coordinate transformation significantly changes the form of original quadratic functional. The penalty matrices become dependent on the system state. The linearity of the transformed system structure and the quadratic functional make it possible to pass over from the Hamilton-Jacoby-Bellman equation (HJB) to the state dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) upon the control synthesis. Note that it is rather difficult to solve the obtained form of SDRE analytically in the general case. In this study, we construct the guaranteed control method from the point of view of the system quality based on feedback linearization of the nonlinear system; the transformation of the cost function upon linearization is examined, as well as the system behavior in the presence of disturbance and the control synthesis for this case. The presented example illustrates the application of the proposed control method for the feedback linearizable nonlinear system. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.","Differential game; Feed Back Linearization; Optimal control; State Dependent Riccati Equation",,"American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA);International Federation of Information Processing (IFIP);International Federation of Nonlinear Analysts (IFNA);American Institute of Physics (AIP);Vienna City Administration",,"9th International Conference on Mathematical Problems in Engineering, Aerospace and Sciences, ICNPAA 2012","10 July 2012 through 14 July 2012","Vienna",,0094243X,9780735411050,,"English","AIP Conf.

Innovation processes are dynamic and global. Actors must adapt their strategies tonew contexts, including the increasingly knowledge-based global competition. They must reconcile the need for speed in commercial exploitation of new products in order to ensure continuous investments with long lead-time in the development of radical innovation capabilities. For the world leaders in their industries, suppliers are becoming ever more important not only as sources but also contributors to innovation, which requires complementary and open interaction between the private sector and public research. The trend is toward open innovation processes, that make possible the overcoming of geographic, institutional and disciplinary barriers. It discusses new approaches to innovation management in the framework of the ""open innovation paradigm,"" which include the following: an output-, or result-, orientation regardless of the place of generation and origin of inputs to innovation; the optimization of all aspects of innovation processes; synchronization of company's internal innovation strategies with that of external partners; and knowledge sharing through partnerships. The open innovation model is aimed at seizing benefits from networking by all collaborators, irrespective of their size and activity. The authors provide general recommendations on the policy mix to foster innovation in the commercial sector and the public research. These include strengthening the connection between basic and applied research, promotion of networking and strategic collaborative projects, and special emphasis on supporting small and medium enterprises.","Business strategies; Open innovation; Public policy; Public research; R and D internationalization; Spillovers",,,,,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886460823

A thorough evaluation of criteria and methods used in Foresightanalysis would permit the improved effectiveness of Foresight activities. The resultscould be set against the aims to decide on the feasibility of projects and identify ways to improve them. Despite great interest in Foresight evaluation demonstrated by stakeholders at various levels, the general principles for conducting it have not yet been formulated, which hinders its development and the diffusion of successful expertise. The purpose of this paper is to identify the basic elements - criteria and methods - usedin evaluating national Foresight. It presents the most interesting results for specifictasks, the themes examined, the methods and the findings, in general. In addition, the study allowed some inference about theory and practice of project management. The study reveals that a key motivation for evaluation of Foresight projects is to provide feedbackto national Foresight organizations and identify areas for further development. Evaluation is used to guide Foresight (in varying degrees) and provide lessons learned for future projects (for example, simplifying implementation, involving business and social organizations, recognizing the need for better compliance with the methodology and objectives of the study participants). The paper serves to develop a general methodology for assessing national Foresight programmes. A further agenda is to develop a comprehensiveanalysis of Foresight, ensure comparability of results of Foresight evaluation initiatives in different countries, promote standardization of evaluation procedures.","Best practices; Evaluation; Foresight; Project management",,,,,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886474020

If a company has already bought some advertising terms which describe certain services, it is reasonable to find out the terms bought by competing companies. On the other hand, the company, that provides context advertisement, wants to discover prospective markets, the advertisers. It can be done by means of so-called biclustering. For binary relation firms × terms the most natural bicluster definition is a tuple of two subsets of firms and terms respectively, where each firm from the first component buys each term from the second one. To solve this task there is a well-developed notion of formal concept which has almost equivalent definition to such a bicluster in terms of object-attribute tables in Formal Concept Analysis. However, the number of formal concepts (biclusters) for a given dataset can be of exponential size in the worst case. To avoid this difficulty we proposed a new concept-based biclustering method. The new bicluster definition, (dense) object-attribute bicluster or simply oa-bicluster, is a relaxation of formal concept notion. Our findings shows that the number of (dense) oa-biclusters is no greater than the number of non-empty cells of initial binary relation.

The traditional assumption that prefixes are semantically ""empty"" when used to form aspectual pairs is problematic because the same prefixes are clearly ""non-empty"" when combined with other base verbs. Though some scholars have suspected that the prefixes are not empty but instead have meanings that overlap with the meanings of the base verbs, proof of this hypothesis has eluded researchers. With the advent of corpora and electronic resources it is possible to explore this question on the basis of large quantities of data. This article presents a new methodology, called ""radial category profiling"", in which the semantic network of a prefix is established on the basis of its ""non-empty"" uses and then compared, node by node, with the semantic network of base verbs that use the same prefix as an ""empty"" perfectivizing morpheme. This methodology facilitates a comprehensive analysis of ten prefixes, comparing their meanings in ""non-empty"" and ""empty"" uses and showing precisely how in the latter case overlap produces the illusion of emptiness. We are able to fully specify the semantic network of each prefix, and discover that for some prefixes there is overlap throughout the network, while for others overlap is restricted to a contiguous subsection of the network. We investigate the dynamic interactions among prefixes, and identify what meanings are incompatible with the ""purely aspectual"" function of the so-called ""empty"" prefixes.

We prove uniform in time stability with respect to initial data and a free term in two norms, under suitable conditions on an operator in the approximate TBC. We also consider the corresponding method on an infinite mesh on the half-axis. We derive explicitly the discrete TBC allowing us to restrict the latter method to a finite mesh. The operator in the discrete TBC is a discrete convolution in time; inturn its kernel is a multiple discrete convolution. The stability conditions are justified for it. The accomplished computations confirm that high order finite elements coupled to the discrete TBC are effective even in the case of highly oscillating solutions and discontinuous potentials. © American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.","Approximate and discrete transparent boundary conditions; Discrete convolution operator; Finite element method; Galerkin method; Stability; The time-dependent Schrödinger equation; The tunnel effect",,,,,,,,19375093,,,"English","Kinet.

In this chapter, the authors propose a method based on cross-validation for diagnosing the strengths and weaknesses of recommender algorithms. The method not only splits initial data into a training and test subsets, but also splits the attribute set into a hidden and visible part. Experiments were performed on a userbased and item-based recommender algorithm.

Initially used only by large financial institutions, short selling has now attracted an increasing number of small investors, even during the crises of 2008 and 2009. Short selling in Russia is regulated by a governmental body, the Federal Financial Markets Service (FFMS), and by specific rules set by the stock market. Elaborated accounting systems are required by Russian authorities to ensure that short sales are accounted separately and in addition, each investor has to provide his/her broker with collateral in the form of cash, cash equivalents, or other securities. Brokers are entitled to short sell only quoted securities and each exchange has to form a list of the most liquid securities on a quarterly basis that can be traded in the next quarter according to the liquidity rating rules set by the FFMS. After the drop in stock prices on Russian stock markets, the FFMS banned short selling to prevent further speculations on September 18, 2008 and short selling was finally allowed again only on June 15, 2009, to improve market liquidity. A comparison of various asset allocation strategies, including a new methodology based on the positive and negative potential for the price (or return) on the next day is presented. The comparison is performed by using stocks allowed for short selling in the fourth quarter of 2010 in Russian stock markets. The findings demonstrate advantages of using short selling in active portfolio management in Russian markets and the most preferable strategy on a long-term investment horizon is the long-short trading strategy. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The goal of these studies is to determine the optimal variant of spacecraft delivery into a near-Venus orbit. The criterion of optimization is the payload mass. Several scenarios of transfer from interplanetary orbit onto low Venus orbit are considered beginning from the classical method of applying a rocket engine velocity impulse. As an alternative concept the direct entry into atmosphere is analyzed supposing that after atmospheric drag deceleration the spacecraft leaves the atmosphere, achieving an orbit with apocenter above the atmosphere and pericenter below the planet's surface. By applying appropriate velocity impulses, the spacecraft is finally transferred into low orbit. The problem of optimal control of aerodynamic forces during this maneuver is solved. It is supposed that the lift force during aerobraking maneuver changes its direction by rotating the spacecraft about its longitudinal axis. Also intermediate methods to reach low orbit are analyzed when initially the spacecraft is transferred into a high elliptical orbit by engine impulse and by later successive comparatively small aerobraking maneuvers. The maximum overload during these maneuvers is determined by the maximum allowed temperature on the surface of the heat shield of the spacecraft. Comparison of the described methods is presented taking into account the payload mass, technical risks and overall duration of maneuvers. © 2012 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) of the properties of some of the instruments have revealed that three pairs of values were excessively highly correlated. This led Davidov et al. (2008) to propose unifying values. To overcome the problems of loss of precision due to unifying distinct values, Knoppen and Saris (2009a,b) investigated the factorial structure of each of the ten values measured with the PVQ (Schwartz et al. 2001). They identified both cross-loadings and distinct sub-dimensions for the pairs of nondiscriminated values in two German student samples. They concluded that the original strategy for selecting items, maximizing theoretical coverage at the expense of item homogeneity, produced the poor discrimination between values. Our Study 1 examines whether the Knoppen and Saris findings generalize to a representative sample of the German population. With some notable exceptions, our findings replicate theirs. Study 2 uses 33 items from an experimental version of the PVQ to operationalize and test a full model of the 11 basic values. Following Knoppen and Saris, we included only one sub-dimension of each of the 11 values. This CFA model yielded a satisfactory fit with no estimation problems.

This technique allows to investigate the generation and relaxation of positive and negative charges, accumulating in, nano-thickness gate dielectric of MOS structures under many stressing situations. The parameters characterizing the change of charge state in the thin oxide layers of MOS structures during the stress have been monitored by means of time dependence of voltage shift applied to a sample during the injection. The method takes into account the process of the MOS capacitance charging by the constant current pulse. In comparison with the conventional techniques our method is nondestructive and enables to reduce the high-field stress time while measuring the injection current-voltage characteristics of the MOS-structure. We consider this method to provide higher accuracy and to decrease the probability of dielectric breakdown.

The proof is geometric and it is based on the results of [Braverman, Finkelberg, and Gaitsgory, Uhlenbeck spaces via affine Lie algebras, Progr. Math., 244, 17-135, 2006] about intersection cohomology of certain Uhlenbeck-type moduli spaces (in fact, our proof is conditioned upon the assumption that the results of [Braverman, Finkelberg, and Gaitsgory, Uhlenbeck spaces via affine Lie algebras, Progr. Math., 244, 17-135, 2006] are valid in positive characteristic; we believe that generalizing [Braverman, Finkelberg, and Gaitsgory, Uhlenbeck spaces via affine Lie algebras, Progr. Math., 244, 17-135, 2006] to the case of positive characteristic should be essentially straightforward but we have not checked the details). In particular, we give a geometric explanation of certain combinatorial differences between finitedimensional and affine case (observed earlier by Macdonald and Cherednik), which here manifest themselves by the fact that the affine Gindikin-Karpelevich formula has an additional term compared to the finite-dimensional case. Very roughly speaking, that additional term is related to the fact that the loop group of an affine Kac-Moody group (which should be thought of as some kind of ""double loop group"") does not behave well from algebro-geometric point of view; however, it has a better behaved version, which has something to do with algebraic surfaces. A uniform (i.e. valid for all local fields) and unconditional (but not geometric) proof of the affine Gindikin-Karpelevich formula is going to appear in [Braverman, Kazhdan, and Patnaik, The Iwahori-Hecke algebra for an affine Kac-Moody group (in preparation)]. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",,"Affine Lie algebra; Algebraic surfaces; Double-loop; Iwahori-Hecke algebras; Local fields; Loop groups; Moduli space; Point of views; Geometry; Algebra",,,,,,,21905614,,,"English","Springer Proc.

The first of them is Spectr-Roentgen-Gamma intended to explore the sky in X-ray and Gamma-ray band. There are technical constraints on this project's realization, influencing the scenario of inserting the spacecraft into the operational orbit. One of these constraints is the location of the available ground station. Due to the high latitude of Russian stations it is impossible to have visibility of the spacecraft from them during those phases of flight when the spacecraft is well below the ecliptic plane. To avoid this phenomenon, it is necessary to decrease the orbit amplitude in the direction orthogonal to the ecliptic plane. There are several methods how to do this including one with gravity assist maneuvers near Moon or use of the rocket engine for correction maneuvers, but the simplest - the search of an appropriate option within the family of possible transfer trajectories. In the paper all these approaches are analyzed and it is shown that for standard scenario for them some difficulties do exist leading to the decrease the reliability of mission at large. The reason is that the thrust of the spacecraft rocket engines is too low, leading to burn durations that are too long. For more practical approach, it is proposed to use the upper stage of the launcher for the maneuvers intended to decrease the amplitude of the orbit in the ecliptic pole direction. This leads to increasing the duration of spacecraft visibility to an acceptable level for the ground stations situated on the Russian territory. But the most promising and effective option is a single impulse trajectory with an optimal choice of the initial orbital state vector. Also the problem of reaching the maximum amplitude of the orbit normal to the ecliptic, the ""Z-amplitude"", is considered. This goal is to be reached for another project - Millimetron. This project goal is to build a space interferometer with very long base consisting of two telescopes: one in space near the [Sun-Earth L2] libration point and the other on the Earth's surface. It is shown that it is possible to put the spacecraft into an orbit with a Z-amplitude value of more than one million kilometers, practically with the same velocity impulse as for orbits © 2012 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

This paper investigates changes in birth control practices in the three countries and searches for an explanation of the diverging trends in abortion. Methods: Official abortion and contraceptive use statistics, provided by national statistical agencies, were analysed. Respective laws and other legal documents were examined and compared between the three countries. To disclose inter-country differences in prevalence of the modern methods of contraception and its association with major demographic and social factors, an analysis of data from national sample surveys was performed, including binary logistic regression. Results: The growing gap in abortion rate in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine is a genuine phenomenon, not a statistical artefact. The examination of abortion and prevalence of contraception based on official statistics and three national sample surveys did not reveal any unambiguous factors that could explain differences in abortion dynamics in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. However, it is very likely that the cause of the inter-country discrepancies lies in contraceptive behavior itself, in adequacies of contraceptive knowledge and practices. Additionally, large differences in government policies, which are very important in shaping contraceptive practices of the population, were detected. Conclusion: Since the end of the 1990s, the Russian government switched to archaic ideology in the area of reproductive health and family planning and neglects evidence-based arguments. Such an extreme turn in the governmental position is not observed in Belarus or Ukraine. This is an important factor contributing to the slowdown in the decrease of abortion rates in Russia. © 2012 Denisov et al.",,"abortion; adult; article; Belarus; birth control; contraception; document examination; family planning; female; health care policy; human; reproductive health; Russian Federation; sexual behavior; social aspect; trend study; Ukraine; Abortion, Induced; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Contraception Behavior; Contraception, Barrier; Data Collection; Family Planning Services; Female; Humans; Intrauterine Devices; Male; Middle Aged; Ovulation Inhibition; Pregnancy; Republic of Belarus; Russia; Sterilization, Reproductive; Ukraine; Young Adult",,,,,,,19326203,,,"English","PLoS ONE",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870675175

Taking into account the effects of the Basel II regulation during the crisis 2008-2009, in particular, the excessive procyclicality of the capital requirements, it is important to investigate the consequences of its adoption for the stability of the banking system in Russia. The aim of this paper is to model the Russian banking system capital adequacy under the Basel II IRB approach. The main hypothesis tested refers to the existence of the procyclicality effect of the capital adequacy for the whole banking system as if Basel II has been introduced. The research is based on publicly available quarterly financial statements of all the Russian banks for the period 2004Q1-2010Q1. Copulas are used to model joint banking risk distribution. The methodology consists of three steps. First of all, the copula structural shift for the joint risk distribution for the Russian banking system is assessed in order to examine the dynamics of the individual risks' dependence and analyze the change in the level of the banking system stability. Secondly, risk-weighted assets are modelled using copula. Finally, the Value-at-Risk approach is employed to arrive at the capital adequacy ratio for the Russian banking system. The analysis of the copula structural shift shows the downward change in the risks' interconnection starting from the third quarter of 2005 being associated with the increased stability of the banking system. The Basel II capital adequacy ratio fell to the minimum of 4% during the period 2009-2010, while the Basel I capital adequacy ratio was well above 15%. However, the hypothesis of the procyclical nature of Basel II is rejected. The research undertaken highlights the necessity for further investigation and calibration of the models proposed in Basel II and Basel III. Moreover, it is important to work out the appropriate policy options with respect to banks bearing high risks under Basel II. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: Built upon the concept of the systemic foresight methodology, the Scan-4-Light approach involves the integrated use of horizon scanning, network analysis and evolutionary scenarios combined with expert consultations and workshops. The study identified the emerging trends, issues, weak signals and wild cards; created high-value visualisations to emphasize the results and findings; and produced narratives to increase the impact and awareness of the development issues. Findings: The Scan-4-Light project has resulted in a large number of specific outputs, providing the views of the Searchlight newsletters' contents at various levels of granularity. It has set out to show how the tools used here can be applied to illustrate the relationships among issues, and how these vary across countries and regions over time, and are linked to various stakeholders and possible solutions to problems. Research limitations/implications: Scan-4-Light demonstrates how foresight tools and techniques can be used for the analysis of complex and uncertain issues, such as development and poverty, in a systemic way. Practical implications: The Scan-4-Light approach can be applied in a number of areas for scanning and identifying emerging trends and issues, and understanding the relationships between systems and solutions. Social implications: The paper gives evidence that most of the issues, if not all, related to development are not isolated, but interlinked and interconnected.

An outside option is referred to as the opportunity of an incumbent ruler to continue his career outside his current territory of control. The paper uses data on the effectiveness of tax collection and the repressiveness of tax jurisprudence for Russian regions in 2007-2009 and finds that regions ruled by governors with substantial outside options are characterized by more repressive behavior of tax authorities. However, surprisingly, the same tax authorities collect less additional revenues for the public budget. It conjectures that the presence of an outside option induces autocrats to behave like 'roving bandits': they use tax audits to establish control over regional companies, but exploit this control to extract private rents rather than revenues for the regional budget used for public goods provision. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"governance approach; political system; public goods; tax system; Russian Federation",,,,,,,00235962,,,"English","Kyklos",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867882524

However, unlike the controls, in mutagenized testes these damages were more pronounced. Thus, the process of restoring a normal pattern of spermatogenesis was slower. In addition, on day 35 of fixation, mature gametes were almost completely absent in the cauda epididymis and a large number of sperm cells with abnormal head shape (58.5 versus 1.7% in the controls) appeared in the testes. Using spermatogonial and meiotic micronucleus assay, we found that dipin did not induce a rise in the number of gross chromosomal mutations in the spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs): on days 35, 56, and 100 postinjection, the incidence of aberrant spermatogonia and round spermatids was not significantly different from the saline control. The degree of gametic chromatin decondensation was evaluated after treatment of the cauda epididymal sperm with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and dithiothreitol (DTT). Judging by the results of the in vitro sperm chromatin decondensation on days 7, 14, 35, 56, and 100 after the injection of dipin or saline, the number of decondensed nuclei decreased sharply in the studied samples as compared with the sperm from intact animals where sperm cells with fully decondensed chromatin prevailed. © 2012 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,"Animalia; Mus",,,,,,,10623590,,BRASE,"English","Biol.

Under specific conditions imposed on atmospheric parameters, solutions can be found in the form of travelling waves with variable amplitudes and wave numbers that do not reflect in the atmosphere in spite of its strong inhomogeneity. Model representations for the sound speed have been found, for which waves can propagate in the atmosphere without reflection. A wave energy flux retains these reflectionless profiles, which confirms that energy can be transferred to high altitudes. The number of these model representations is fairly large, which makes it possible to approximate real vertical distributions of the sound speed in the Earth's atmosphere using piecewise reflectionless profiles. The Earth's standard atmosphere is shown to be well approximated by four reflectionless profiles with weak jumps in the sound speed gradient. It has been established that the Earth's standard atmosphere is almost completely transparent for the considered vertical acoustic waves in a wide range of frequencies, which is confirmed by observational data and conclusions derived using numerical solutions of original equations. © 2012 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,,,,,,,00167932,,,"English","Geomagn.

Those could be relations between friends, wife-husband relationships, relations between business partners, and so on. At a certain level of analysis, a society can be regarded as a gigantic maze constituted of one-to-one relationships between people. From a physical standpoint it can be considered as a highly porous medium. Such media are widely known for their outstanding properties and effects like self-organized criticality, percolation, power-law distribution of network cluster sizes, etc. In these media supercritical events, referred to as dragon-kings, may occur in two cases: when increasing stress is applied to a system (self-organized criticality scenario) or when increasing conductivity of a system is observed (percolation scenario). In social applications the first scenario is typical for negative effects: crises, wars, revolutions, financial breakdowns, state collapses, etc. The second scenario is more typical for positive effects like emergence of cities, growth of firms, population blow-ups, economic miracles, technology diffusion, social network formation, etc. If both conditions (increasing stress and increasing conductivity) are observed together, then absolutely miraculous dragon-king effects can occur that involve most human society. Historical examples of this effect are the emergence of the Mongol Empire, world religions, World War II, and the explosive proliferation of global internet services. This article describes these two scenarios in detail beginning with an overview of historical dragon-king events and phenomena starting from the early human history till the last decades and concluding with an analysis of their possible near future consequences on our global society. Thus we demonstrate that in social systems dragon-king is not a random outlier unexplainable by power-law statistics, but a natural effect. It is a very large cluster in a porous percolation medium. It occurs as a result of changes in external conditions, such as supercritical load, increase in system elements' sensitivity, or system connectivity growth. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The paper employs intellectual capital on the intersection of value-based management (VBM) and the resource-based view (RBV). Starting from a review of the results provided in the literature regarding intellectual capital (IC) evaluation and its link with firm performance, a system of proxy indicators related to IC transformation in both concepts has been designed. The evaluation ability of the developed model was justified using regression analyses. A detailed algorithm for intellectual capital evaluation in terms of input-outcome transformation. The intellectual capital transformation evaluating model (ICTEM) provides a holistic view of intellectual resources as companies’ strategic investments. The paper emphasizes that the ICTEM framework could be mostly applied for the analysis of a firm as a typical representative of the industry or the country. In that sense it is not applicable for specific feature analysis of a company. The paper highlights the ICTEM as a tool of investment decisions, mostly taking into account common trends, the prospects of industries, and economies’ development.

However, there is still relatively limited evidence on its effects on academic performance. Moreover, the predicted effect of exposure to prenatal testosterone (T)-which is inversely correlated with the relative length of the second to fourth finger lengths (2D:4D)-would seem to have ambiguous effects on academic achievement since traits like aggressiveness or risk-taking are not uniformly positive for success in school. We provide the first evidence of a non-linear, quadratic, relationship between 2D:4D and academic achievement using samples from Moscow and Manila. We also find that there is a gender differentiated link between various measures of academic achievement and measured digit ratios. These effects are different depending on the field of study, choice of achievement measure, and use of the right hand or left digit ratios. The results seem to be asymmetric between Moscow and Manila where the right (left) hand generates inverted-U (U-shaped) curves in Moscow while the pattern for hands reverses in Manila.

Human empowerment theory (HET) posits two sequential mechanisms. First, cognitive empowerment through rising levels of education and knowledge leads to motivational empowerment, manifest in rising emancipative values. Second, rising emancipative values nurture mass aspirations for liberal democracy, leading to more effective democratic practices. Using World Values Survey (WVS) data from a dozen Asian societies, Bomhoff and Gu claim that Asia is different because these mechanisms do not work among Asian societies. Against these claims, this response shows that Bomhoff and Gu's results are inconclusive.

The book discusses how the use of some election rules embedded in the U.S. Constitution and in the Presidential Succession Act may cause skewed or weird election outcomes and election stalemates. The book argues that the act may not cover some rare though possible situations which the Twentieth Amendment authorizes Congress to address. Also, the book questions the constitutionality of the National Popular Vote Plan to introduce a direct popular presidential election de facto, without amending the Constitution, and addresses the plan's ""Achilles' Heel."" In particular, the book shows that the plan may violate the Equal Protection Clause from the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. Numerical examples are provided to show that the counterintuitive claims of the NPV originators and proponents that the plan will encourage presidential candidates to ""chase"" every vote in every state do not have any grounds. Finally, the book proposes a plan for improving the election system by combining at the national level the ""one state, one vote"" principle - embedded in the Constitution - and the ""one person, one vote"" principle. Under this plan no state loses its current Electoral College benefits while all the states gain more attention of presidential candidates. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

Each project requires a certain volume of investment to be distributed within a period of time that is a subset of consecutive time segments from [1,T], some projects from the set can generate profit upon completion according to a certain schedule, and the generated profit can be reinvested in the other projects. In the basic problem, it is assumed that all the projects are equally important (so that there are no priorities for choosing a subset of projects that should commence or be completed earlier that the others), and there is no order for executing any projects from the set. These assumptions transform the basic problem into a problem of finding an optimal order (schedule) for commencing the projects, where optimality can be understood, for instance, in the sense of the number of projects that can be completed within the period [1,T]. A mathematical formulation of the basic problem in the form of a Boolean programming one is proposed, and some generalizations of the problem, including those obtained by imposing certain precedence conditions on the execution of the projects, are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The subsequent events have confirmed this supposition. That is why in the present article we develop this important theme. The article offers a thorough analysis of the internal conditions of Arab countries on the eve of revolutionary events, as well as causes and consequences of the Arab Revolutions. The article also offers an analysis of similar historical World System reconfigurations starting with the sixteenth-century Reformation. The analysis is based on the theory (developed by the authors) of the periodical catch-ups experienced by the political component of the World System that tends to lag behind the World System economic component. Thus, we show that the asynchrony of development of various functional subsystems of the World System is a cause of the synchrony of major political changes. In other words, within the globalization process, political transformations tend to lag far behind economic transformations. And such lags cannot constantly increase, the gaps are eventually bridged, but in not quite a smooth way. The article also suggests an explanation why the current catch-up of the World System political component started in the Arab World. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Arab Spring; Arab world; Islamic world; Middle East; new coalitions; new epoch; revolution; World System; World System reconfigurations; youth bulge.",,,,,,,,02604027,,,"English","World Futures J.

Theoretically, electoral authoritarian regimes should have an informational advantage that makes them more robust than other types of authoritarian regimes, but much empirical evidence suggests otherwise. In this article we offer a new perspective on why this might be the case. Specifically, we consider how authoritarian elections influence a ruler's choices in making cadre appointments. We argue that the imperative of winning authoritarian elections forces authoritarian leaders to prioritize the appointment of politically loyal cadres, who can help the regime win elections. This choice often comes at the expense of appointing officials who are competent at making good public policy and promoting economic development, factors that may contribute to long-term regime stability. We test this theory using an original dataset of gubernatorial appointments in one leading contemporary authoritarian regime, Russia.

We show that if G is not simply-connected, then there exists a finite number of different sectors of the Higgs bundles endowed with the Hitchin Hamiltonians. They correspond to different characteristic classes of the underlying bundles defined as elements of H 2(Σ g, Z{stroke}(G)), (Z{stroke}(G)) is a center of G). We define the conformal version CG of G - an analog of GL(N) for SL(N), and relate the characteristic classes with degrees of CG-bundles. We describe explicitly bundles in the genus one (g=1) case. If Σ 1 has one marked point and the bundles are trivial then the Hitchin systems coincide with Calogero-Moser (CM) systems. For the nontrivial bundles we call the corresponding systems the modified Calogero-Moser (MCM) systems. Their phase space has the same dimension as the phase space of the CM systems with spin variables, but less number of particles and greater number of spin variables. Starting with these bundles we construct Lax operators, quadratic Hamiltonians, and define the phase spaces and the Poisson structure using dynamical r-matrices. The latter are completion of the classification list of Etingof-Varchenko corresponding to the trivial bundles. To describe the systems we use a special basis in the Lie algebras that generalizes the basis of 't Hooft matrices for sl(N). We find that the MCM systems contain the standard CM subsystems related to some (unbroken) subalgebras. The configuration space of the CM particles is the moduli space of the stable holomorphic bundles with non-trivial characteristic classes. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,,,,,,,00103616,,,"English","Commun.

GES accumulates a compact set of information about the search space to generate promising initial solutions for the techniques that require a starting solution, such as the simple local search method. GES has been successful for many classic discrete optimization problems: the unconstrained quadratic programming problem, the maximum satisfiability problem, the max-cut problem, the multidimensional knapsack problem and the job-shop scheduling problem.

New features for investigating similarity of digraphs are formulated. The original problem of calculating similarity of layout of fragments in the digraph is formalized with account of quantitative and qualitative features of fragments of the digraph. A methodology, involving two systems of methods for solving the problem, is developed. The first system of methods takes into account the precise layout of fragments in the digraph, while the second one deals with the approximate layout of fragments. A new class of problems is distinguished, which consists in calculating similarity of digraphs with account of similarity of the layout of fragments of the specified type.

I develop a model of learning in which acquisition of skill is only possible through personal interaction with a skilled individual; the income of the skilled is sensitive to financial constraints for the unskilled. Cross-country differences in such constraints have a multiplicative effect on the skill premium, causing outmigration of skilled individuals from a less developed country. I study welfare implications of such brain drain for the sending and receiving countries. Although it makes more difficult skill acquisition in the sending country, the unskilled may still be better off: increased cost of skill acquisition is offset by higher income once the skill has been acquired. For the receiving country, I identify a phenomenon of immiserizing immigration: a depletion of the stock of skill in the sending country due to brain drain hinders further production of skill, which may hurt the receiving country. Additionally, I find that increased openness of the sending country to migration and the resultant accelerated brain drain increase the incentives of the country government to reduce financial frictions. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Brain drain; Financial constraints; Immiserizing immigration; Skill acquisition","brain drain; human capital; income; international migration; labor migration; returns to education; skilled labor; welfare impact",,,,,,,01660462,,,"English","Reg.

The finding show that this policy shift has disconnected Russian interest rates from US dollar-denominated interest rates, while instead linking them to a synthetic interest rate composed of USD and EUR rates at the same proportion as that of these two currencies in the currency basket against which the ruble's exchange rate is set. The Russian experience shows that while the adoption of bi-currency targeting may help ensure that domestic interest rates are less dependent on the monetary cycle of a single country, these rates are instead likely to reflect financial developments in all countries whose currencies are included in the currency basket.

On the basis of this comparison, I show that the STS programme in economic methodology may prove fruitful in the future, but there is still a place for more aprioristic philosophical thinking.

Both academic discussions and officials' attitudes toward protests prove contradictory. Even in periods of increase, labor activism has remained limited. Yet authorities continue to show concern about real and potential discontent, while academics puzzle over the dominance of quiescence as well as the reasons for sporadic activism. The research presented in this article advances our understanding of both: the limits of protest, and the causes, forms and goals of Russian labor's periodic collective activism. We rely on a combination of available statistical and recent survey data to try to resolve the paradoxes of labor's quiescence and conflict, as well as elites' neglect and concern.The research finds changes in patterns of labor activism over the two decades. During the 1990s, most strikes were limited, defensive, managed, or desperate in character. In Russia's recovered economy, from 2006 a qualitatively different, "" classical"" pattern of strikes and labor relations emerged. Workers' collective actions mainly affected large, profitable industrial and transnational enterprises and took the form of "" normalized"" bargaining and conflict between labor and management. With the 2008-09 recession workers returned to the defensive strategies of the 1990s, protesting wage cuts and factory closures. Survey research from 2010 shows workers to be almost evenly divided between groups with positive and negative attitudes toward solidarity and bargaining. © 2012 The Regents of the University of California.","Industrial relations; Labor; Labor activism; Protest; Quiescence; Russia; Strikes; Trade unions; Workers",,,,,,,,0967067X,,,"English","Communist Post-Communist Stud.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870397428

Since it was formulated (more than 50 years ago), the problem has incorporated additional industrial factors and constraints while its solution methods have been constantly improving in terms of the solution quality and CPU times. However, despite all the efforts made, the available solution methods (including those for a popular model based on the p-median problem, PMP) are prone to two major types of errors. The first error (the modeling one) occurs when the intended objective function of the CF (as a rule, verbally formulated) is substituted by the objective function of the PMP. The second error (the algorithmic one) occurs as a direct result of applying a heuristic for solving the PMP. In this paper we show that for instances that make sense in practice, the modeling error induced by the PMP is negligible. We exclude the algorithmic error completely by solving the adjusted pseudo-Boolean formulation of the PMP exactly, which takes less than one second on a general-purpose PC and software. Our experimental study shows that the PMP-based model produces high-quality cells and in most cases outperforms several contemporary approaches. © 2012 INFORMS.","Cell formation; Group technology; P-median problem; Pseudo-Boolean polynomial","Algorithmic errors; Cell formation; CPU time; Experimental studies; High quality; Model-based OPC; Modeling errors; Objective functions; P-median problems; Pseudo-Boolean; Solution methods; Solution quality; Algorithms; Cellular manufacturing; Group technology; Boolean algebra",,,,,,,0030364X,,OPREA,"English","Oper Res",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869741855

Despite the increasingly broad use of perfusion applications, we still have no generally accessible means for their verification: The common sense of perfusion maps and ""bona fides"" of perfusion software vendors remain the only grounds for acceptance. Thus, perfusion applications are one of a very few clinical tools considerably lacking practical objective hands-on validation. MATERIALS AND METHODS. To solve this problem, we introduce digital perfusion phantoms (DPPs) - numerically simulated DICOM image sequences specifically designed to have known perfusion maps with simple visual patterns. Processing DPP perfusion sequences with any perfusion algorithm or software of choice and comparing the results with the expected DPP patterns provide a robust and straightforward way to control the quality of perfusion analysis, software, and protocols. RESULTS. The deviations from the expected DPP maps, observed in each perfusion software, provided clear visualization of processing differences and possible perfusion implementation errors. CONCLUSION. Perfusion implementation errors, often hidden behind real-data anatomy and noise, become very visible with DPPs. We strongly recommend using DPPs to verify the quality of perfusion applications. © American Roentgen Ray Society.","Deconvolution; Digital perfusion phantoms; Medical errors; Perfusion; Perfusion algorithms; Perfusion validation tool; Quality assurance; Truncated singular value decomposition","article; blood flow; blood volume; clinical protocol; computer assisted tomography; computer program; contrast enhancement; image display; image processing; noise; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phantom; priority journal; quality control; radiation attenuation; statistical model; validation process; Algorithms; Artifacts; Blood Flow Velocity; Blood Volume; Models, Theoretical; Perfusion Imaging; Phantoms, Imaging; Software; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,,,,,,0361803X,,AJROA,"English","Am.

In the permutational scenario, the sequence of jobs has to remain the same in all machines. The Flowshop Problem (FSP) is known to be NP-hard when more than three machines are considered. Thus, for medium and large scale instances, high-quality heuristics are needed to find good solutions in reasonable time. We propose and analyse parallel hybrid search methods that fully use the computational power of current multi-core machines. The parallel methods combine a memetic algorithm (MA) and several iterated greedy algorithms (IG) running concurrently. Two test scenarios were included, with short and long CPU times. The tests were conducted on the set of benchmark instances introduced by Taillard (Eur. J. Oper. Res. 64:278-285, 1993), commonly used to assess the performance of new methods. Results indicate that the use of the MA to manage a pool of solutions is highly effective, allowing the improvement of the best known upper bound for one of the instances. © 2012 Springer Science &amp; Business Media, LLC.","Combinatorial optimization; Flowshop problem; Memetic algorithms; Metaheuristics; Scheduling",,,,,,,,02545330,,,"English","Ann.

A property X is called factorial if X is hereditary (i.e., closed under taking induced subgraphs) and n c1n≤X n≤n c2n for some positive constants c1 and c2. Hereditary properties with speed slower than factorial are surprisingly well structured. The situation with factorial properties is more complicated and less explored. To better understand the structure of factorial properties we look for minimal superfactorial ones. In [J.P. Spinrad, Nonredundant 1's in Γ-free matrices, SIAM J. Discrete Math. 8 (1995) 251-257], Spinrad showed that the number of n-vertex chordal bipartite graphs is 2 Θ(nlog2n), which means that this class is superfactorial. On the other hand, all subclasses of chordal bipartite graphs that have been studied in the literature, such as forest, bipartite permutation, bipartite distance-hereditary or convex graphs, are factorial. In this paper, we study more hereditary subclasses of chordal bipartite graphs and reveal both factorial and superfactorial members in this family. The latter fact shows that the class of chordal bipartite graphs is not a minimal superfactorial one. Finding minimal superfactorial classes in this family remains a challenging open question. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

While the format of debates has been recognized by researchers as one of the most efficient tools of setting off critical thinking, it is up to the new technologies in education to make it possible to bring this platform to a cross-cultural level. Since a cross-cultural dialogue in most cases supposes the mastery of a foreign language, e-learning in the form of cross-border video-conference debates present an invaluable opportunity for educators to enhance the pedagogy of foreign language acquisition around the globe.

Second, the directed enumeration method increases recognition speed even in the most difficult cases which seem to be very important in practical terms. In these cases many neighbors are located at very similar distances. In this paper we present the results of an experimental study of the directed enumeration method with comparison of color- and gradient-orientation histograms in solving the problem of face recognition with well-known datasets (Essex, FERET). It is shown that the proposed method is characterized by increased computing efficiency of automatic image recognition (312 times in comparison with a conventional nearest neighbor classifier). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We extend previous results on the space-time correlation functions of the TASEP, which correspond to exits from the sets bounded by straight vertical or horizontal lines. In particular, our approach allows us to remove ordering of time moments used in previous studies so that only a natural space-like ordering of particle coordinates remains. We consider sequences of general staircase-like boundaries going from the northeast to southwest in the space-time plane. The exit probabilities from the given sets are derived in the form of a Fredholm determinant defined on the boundaries of the sets. In the scaling limit, the staircase-like boundaries are treated as approximations of continuous differentiable curves. The exit probabilities with respect to points of these curves belonging to an arbitrary space-like path are shown to converge to the universal Airy 2 process. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA Medialab srl.","correlation functions; stochastic particle dynamics (theory)",,,,,,,,17425468,,,"English","J.

In general, acquisitions can be associated with synergy gains, internalization advantages, and higher market power. Acquisitions, however, may also give rise to agency problems as well as new integration and organizational costs, leading to an ambiguous overall impact on the performance of acquirers. Based on a sample of more than 600 acquirers we show that both domestic and international acquisitions tend to reduce the performance of acquirers compared to non-acquiring firms. Examining how different deal, firm and industry level characteristics moderate the value destroying effects of acquisitions, our results suggest that Russian acquirers suffer from the inability to leverage value due to low M&A experience and capability, especially when making international acquisitions. © 2011 Association for Comparative Economic Studies.","Emerging countries; FDI; M&A; Restructuring; Russia",,,,,,,,01475967,,,"English","J.

In line with Schwartz's (1992) theory, we conceptualized security as having two distinct components, one concerned with safety of the self (personal security) and the other with harmony and stability of larger groups and of society (group security). Structural equation modelling revealed that universalism values underlie perceptions that immigration has positive consequences and group security values underlie perceptions that it has negative consequences. Personal security makes no unique, additional contribution. Multi-group analyses revealed that these associations are invariant across the three countries except for a stronger link between universalism and perceptions of the consequences of immigration in Spain. To examine whether values mediate relations of traits to perceptions of immigration, we used the five-factor model. Findings supported a full mediation model. Individuals' traits of openness and agreeableness explained significant variance in security and universalism values. Basic values, in turn, explained perceptions of the consequences of immigration. ©2011 The British Psychological Society.",,"adolescent; adult; aged; article; attitude; female; Germany; human; Italy; male; middle aged; migration; perception; social psychology; Spain; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Attitude; Emigration and Immigration; Female; Germany; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Perception; Social Values; Spain; Young Adult",,,,,,,00071269,,,"English","Br.

In this paper, we give an explicit estimate of this Hölder exponent. Moreover, we extend Gorodetski's result from the case when the fibre maps are close to the identity to a much wider class of maps that satisfy the so-called modified dominated splitting condition. In many cases (for example, in the case of skew products over the solenoid or over linear Anosov diffeomorphisms of the torus), the Hölder exponent is close to 1. This allows one to overcome the so-called Fubini nightmare, in some sense. Namely, we prove that the union of central fibres that are strongly atypical from the point of view of ergodic theory, has Lebesgue measure zero despite the lack of absolute continuity of the holonomy map for the central foliation.

The main goal is to make children (including teenagers) be aware of possible social consequences of their misuse of information and communication technologies, in particular, of the cell telephones and the Internet. An original method of early forming the cognitive subspace of moral values and social responsibility is stated. It is a part of the System of Emotional-Imaginative Teaching (the EIT-system) developed and tested by the authors during 1990s-2000s. For describing this method, a new formal notation for representing transformations of the learners' cognitive-emotional sphere and the spectrum of information processing skills is proposed, it is called the notation of the maps of cognitive transformations. The described method of early socialization and the EIT-system as a whole are interpreted as an important component of cognitonics - a new scientific discipline. The paper also represents a new way of considering impressionism under the frame of cognitonics. An original algorithm of transforming the negative emotions (caused by the messages received from social networks) into the positive ones is proposed.

Hence, economists from all over the world are suggesting alternative international currencies that would make the international monetary system more efcient. However, it is essential when approaching the creation of a new international currency to analyse and take into account the experience of all the past international currencies. Terefore this paper begins with an exploration of the drawbacks of each of the past and present international currencies. Drawing on this analysis a justifcation will be made for the necessity of introducing a new international currency, pointing to the requirements it should meet. Further on, this paper proposes an alternative theoretically possible variant of the international currency, with a fxed value relative to a commodity basket.

Today, the Russian Federation, like any other state in the world, is closely connected to non-local events and ideas; the "" title nation"" and "" strong state"" ideas are routinely confronted by challenges from multiple agents including immigrants, the mass media and especially the Internet. In the present study, empirical findings from several studies developed with methods of visual sociology, expert interviews and public opinion research are used to understand how people in Russia tend to realize their desire to be the unit of the state forming so-called "" invisible"" state identity, which is not absolutely loyal to the government institutions and is very stable. This type of identity has been formed under alternative institutional logic which isn't preordained by acting of the state but is shaped as well by cultural, social, and cognitive processes in "" real"" , but especially in "" virtual"" spaces of communication. And despite "" Russia as a state"" is still a way of maintaining the symbolic power of political leaders, there are some strong but hidden tendencies forming "" Russia as a community of citizens"" under the influence of information technologies, global values, norms and outlooks. © 2012 .","Civil identity; National identity; Russian identity; State identity; Visual sociology",,,,,,,,18793665,,,"English","J.

Another side of the problem is the definition of justice as an ideal, norm or historical tradition.

Among them are: the conflict of law and justice in current Russian political reality; social equality and new property relations; national identity and system of government; the form of government and the type of political regime; legitimacy and legality of political transformation; effectiveness of law.

Difference methods based on this system have been successfully used in numerous applications and test gasdynamic computations. In theoretical terms, however, for standard spatial discretizations of this system, the nondecreasing entropy law does not hold exactly even in the one-dimensional case because of the mesh imbalance terms. For the quasi-gasdynamic equations, a new conservative spatial discretization is proposed for which the entropy balance equation has an appropriate form and the entropy production is guaranteed to be nonnegative (which also holds in the presence of body forces and heat sources). An important element of this discretization is that it makes use of nonstandard space-averaging techniques, including a nonlinear ""logarithmic"" averaging of the density and internal energy.

The performance of museums consists of financial performance and qualitative issues, two sets of performance that are targeted by radically different measurement and evaluation practices. The former is more company-like and includes the measurement of organizational efficiency. The latter comprises professional judgments. As in any other organization, both sets of performance are the basis for operative and strategic decisions concerning strategies and budgets. In addition, they provide the basis for various reports to external constituencies. As the consequences stemming from these decisions are severe, an accurate information-generation process and adequate performance measurement systems are essential. © 2012 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

Like other developing and transition countries, it is subject to a growing pressure to ""internationalize"" its scientific activities, which primarily means a shift to English as a language of scientific communication. But to what extent does the transition to English improve the impact of research? The case of Russia is of interest in this respect as the existence of many combinations of national journals and languages of publications (namely, Russian and English, including translated journals) provide a kind of natural I experiment to test the effects of language and publisher's country on the international visibility of research through citations as well as on the referencing practices of authors. Our analysis points to the conclusion that the production of original English-language papers in foreign journals is a more efficient strategy of internationalization than the mere translation of domestic journals. If the objective of a country is to maximize the international visibility of its scientific work, then the efforts should go into the promotion of publication in reputed English-language journals to profit from the added effect provided by the Matthew effect of these venues. © 2012 ASIS&T.","bibliometrics","Bibliometrics; Efficient strategy; Matthew effects; Scientific activity; Scientific communication; Web of Science; Profitability; Publishing; Visibility; Translation (languages)",,,,,,,15322882,,AISJB,"English","J.

In Study 1, results from 11 countries support the original five-factor structure and achieve higher reliability for the axiom dimensions as measured by the new scale. Moreover, moderate but meaningful associations between axiom and Big-Five personality dimensions were found. Temporal change of social axioms at the culture level was examined and found to be moderate. In Study 2, additional new items were generated for social complexity and fate control, then assessed in Hong Kong and the United States. Reliability was further improved for both dimensions. Additionally, two subfactors of fate control were identified: fate determinism and fate alterability. Fate determinism, but not fate alterability, related positively to neuroticism. Other relationships between axiom and personality dimensions were similar to those reported in Study 1. The short forms of the axiom dimensions were generally reliable and correlated highly with the long forms. This research thus provides a stronger foundation for applying the construct of social axioms around the world. © The Author(s) 2012.","attitudes; beliefs; personality; social cognition; values",,,,,,,,00220221,,,"English","J.

These alternative sets of activities can be interpreted either like an entire parallel public sphere where alternative debate is articulated, or like separate parallel activities recompensing supply and demand failures. Two hypotheses are posed by author. The first states that accessibility of media production in general in Russia is a key element of a contemporary social contract. The second hypothesis relates parallel media practices with certain acts of political activism among narrow groups of the population that could not find places for self-expression in the institutionalized media field and use alternative media outlets (especially blogs and another new media) that ultimately constitute the parallel public sphere. © 2012 (Ilya Kiriya).",,,,,,,,,19328036,,,"English","Int.

Furthermore, social welfare increases with the number of big firms because the procompetitive effect associated with entry dominates the resulting decrease in product diversity. © 2012, RAND.",,,,,,,,,07416261,,,"English","RAND J.

Tensor product of Harish-Chandra bimodules is related to convolution of D-modules via the long intertwining functor (Radon transform) by a result of Beilinson and Ginzburg (Represent. Theory 3, 1-31, 1999). Exactness property of the long intertwining functor on a cell subquotient of the Harish-Chandra bimodules category shows that the truncated convolution category of Lusztig (Adv.

Meanwhile, there exists a wide range of different methods to analyze such data, with autoregressive and cross-lagged models being 2 of the most well known representatives. Unfortunately, in these models time is only considered implicitly, making it difficult to account for unequally spaced measurement occasions or to compare parameter estimates across studies that are based on different time intervals. Stochastic differential equations offer a solution to this problem by relating the discrete time model to its underlying model in continuous time. It is the goal of the present article to introduce this approach to a broader psychological audience. A step-by-step review of the relationship between discrete and continuous time modeling is provided, and we demonstrate how continuous time parameters can be obtained via structural equation modeling. An empirical example on the relationship between authoritarianism and anomia is used to illustrate the approach. © 2012 American Psychological Association.","Autoregressive cross-lagged model; Continuous time modeling; Longitudinal data analysis; Panel design; Structural equation modeling","authority; empirical research; human; longitudinal study; psychology; review; social change; social problem; statistical analysis; statistical model; statistics; time; Anomie; Authoritarianism; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Empirical Research; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Models, Statistical; Psychology; Social Change; Stochastic Processes; Time Factors",,,,,,,1082989X,,,"English","Psychol.

We analysed inequalities in risks of dying for Russian men by occupational class and perceived social status in the post-transition era. Methods: Cox proportional analysis of the hazard of dying by occupational class, education, household income and perceived social status was performed for 593 deaths that occurred between 1994 and 2006 using a representative sample of Russia's male population (n=6586 people, 40046 person-years). Occupational class was coded based on the European Socio-Economic Classification; social status was based on survey questionnaires about people's perceived economic, power and respect status. Results: Manual occupational class is significantly associated with greater hazards of dying among men, after adjusting for age, education and other potential confounding variables. Groups at highest risk were men who were manual workers, manual supervisors and technicians, and lower sales and service workers. Substantial gaps in life expectancy at age 21 of up to 10 years were observed between male managers and professionals and manual workers. Conclusion: Substantial inequalities in risks of dying exist by both occupational class and perceived status in Russia, with patterns by class differing from those in the west. © The Author 2011.

It is shown that proto-fuzzy concepts are closely related to crisply generated fuzzy concepts in the sense that the mappings involved in the definitions coincide for crisp subsets of attributes. Moreover, a proto-fuzzy concept determines a crisp subset of attributes, which generates a (crisply generated) fuzzy concept. However, the reverse is true only in part: given a crisp subset of attributes, one can find a proto-fuzzy concept whose intent includes (but not necessarily coincides with) the given subset of attributes. Interval pattern concepts are shown to be related to crisply generated formal concepts. In particular, every crisply closed subset of objects is an extent of an interval pattern concept. Also, we establish some properties of the collection of formal concepts for a given fuzzy context.","crisply generated fuzzy concepts; interval pattern concepts; pattern structures; proto-fuzzy concepts","Closed subsets; Formal concepts; Fuzzy concept; Fuzzy contexts; interval pattern concepts; Pattern structure; proto-fuzzy concepts; Set theory; Textile printing",,,,,,,01692968,,FUINE,"English","Fundam Inf",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861371861

Authorship of the comics involves drawing the 'top level' of the story directly onto paper and projecting lower-level narrative elements, such as objects, characters, dialogue, descriptions and/or events onto the paper via a multi-touch interface. In terms of the impact this has upon the experience of reading and writing, the implementation of paper is intended to facilitate the creation of high-level overviews of stories, while the touch surface allows users to generate branches through the addition of artifacts in accordance with certain theories about interactive narratives. This provides the opportunity to participate in the reading and authoring of both traditional, paper-based texts and interactive, digital scenarios.

However, when accounting for spatial regimes, we find a strong regional convergence among high-income regions located near other high-income regions.

Hereditary properties with speed slower than factorial are surprisingly well structured. The situation with factorial properties is more complicated and less explored. Only the properties with speeds up to the Bell number are well studied and well behaved.

The study of the economic performance of higher educational institutions includes complex analysis of financial and educational components of their structural dynamics and their impact on their development strategy. Design/methodology/approach – The methods used in the study of the segmentation of the higher education sector involve a combination of theoretical developments in economics and the modeling of the economic behavior of universities on the market for educational services, procedures for the evaluation of transaction costs in the markets with asymmetric information and recent conceptions of the interrelation of factors affecting quality and accessibility of higher education. Findings – In this paper, the economic potential of Russian universities is considered, making use of a segmentation of the higher education sector, based on sampling of state and municipal higher education institutions from different industry groups, depending on their development strategy under changing social and economic conditions. The research data for 2006-2009 help to define five clusters of the higher educational establishments with different approaches towards public funding and different strategies.

Evidence constitutes the best summary of knowledge based on several sources of information (several studies, several different research groups, several different methodological approaches, among them the best methods available) which clearly goes beyond individual experience and a few isolated studies. We argue that meta-analyses can and should be used in entrepreneurship research (and that they should also be used to review qualitative studies). Meta-analyses establish certain relationships; these should then be summarized in well-founded models and theories that can be translated into action principles. These action principles can then be used by various users of EBE. Users of EBE can be scientists, professionals who regularly deal with entrepreneurs (bankers, consultants, venture capital providers), policy makers (e.g., government), students of entrepreneurship, and last but not least the entrepreneurs themselves. Once a set of action principles has been developed from science, their application can be tested with the help of further evidence on the efficacy of interventions (including meta-analyses on the interventions). Evidence-based entrepreneurship (EBE) has the potential to change research, teaching, and practice. © 2012 M. Frese, A. Bausch, P. Schmidt, A. Rauch, and R.

However, it appears that numerous-and evidently strong-points of incongruence between Saussurean (and post-Saussurean) semiology and Peirces semiotics do not prevent the possibility of some important theoretical intuitions common to both traditions. In particular, this claim finds support in light of Russian formalism-essentially a Saussurean-type semiotic school that gained wide acclaim in mid-twentieth century Europe alongside French structuralism. Without challenging the truth of the obvious differences between the two schools, this paper undertakes to reinterpret some of the late formalist concepts on the problem of continuity in terms of Peirce's semiotics. The brief account this paper presents has a double objective: (1) to give a particular example of how some basic formalist analytical categories may be placed in the wider context of Peirce's semiotics, thus making the purely structural aspect of meaning a particular case of Peirces theory of signs, and (2) to show the possibility of building a case in which Peirces semiotic ideas might actually be applied as efficient tools in the examination of different traditional discourses. This objective is accomplished by way of a sample analysis of Vladimir Propp's ""Oedipus in Light of Folklore"" in terms of Peirces On a New List of Categories."" © 2012 Walter de Gruyter.","continuity; formalism; history; interpretant; narrative function; semiotics",,,,,,,,00371998,,,"English","Semiotica",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860753764

This result is in fact an artifact of the assumption that the candidates maximize expected vote share or probability of win, which is not true for many real-world elections. In this paper I analyze a probabilistic voting model in which the candidates have preferences other than the maximization of the expected number of votes or the probability of win maximization. I derive the comparative statics for two voters and one-dimensional policy space. Each voter cares about both the policy platform and the identity of the candidate. It is shown that an increase in the value of exactly one vote causes each candidate to choose a position closer to that of its partisan voter. Numeric computation of equilibria show that these results can be generalized to three or more voters. The results imply that the nonlinearity and non-symmetry of payoffs can affect the policy positions of the candidates. © The Author(s) 2012.","candidate payoffs; electoral competition; probabilistic voting; rational choice",,,,,,,,09516298,,,"English","J.

Previous studies have examined only the individual-level effects of values. Studying in addition the 'ecological' effects - how the social prevalence of values affects protest - generates new insights. Focusing on 'emancipative values', two ecological effects are shown: (1) the prevalence of emancipative values lifts people's protest above the level that their own emancipative values suggest (elevator effect); (2) the prevalence of these values enhances the impact of people's own emancipative values on protest (amplifier effect). We conclude that examining values in models of protest (and possibly of other activities), not only as individual attributes but also as ecological properties, gives 'culture' its full weight in explaining behaviour.

The author offers a credible estimate of the size of the country's state banking sector by including banks that are indirectly owned by public organizations. Contrary to some predictions based on the theoretical literature on economic transition, he explains the relatively high profitability and efficiency of Russian state-controlled banks by pointing to their competitive position in such functions as acquisition and disposal of assets on behalf of the government. Also suggested in the paper is a different way of looking at market concentration in Russia (by consolidating the market shares of core state-controlled banks), which produces a picture of a more concentrated market than officially reported. Lastly, one of the author's interesting conclusions is that China provides a better benchmark than the formerly centrally planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe by which to assess the viability of state ownership of banks in Russia and to evaluate the country's banking sector.","Bank assets; Bank deposits; Bank loans; Chinese banks; Government control; Private banks; Public sector; Russia; Russian banks; State-owned banks","banking; financial system; firm ownership; firm size; government; lending behavior; market conditions; market transition; private sector; profitability; public sector; state owned enterprise; Central Europe; China; Eastern Europe",,,,,,,15387216,,,"English","Eurasian Geogr.

Ownership and control structures are in flux throughout the heating sector chain. Inefficiencies, causing low service quality and rising prices, have already started eroding the market share of district heating, despite its potential benefits. End-use management practices - such as lack of metering, communal billing, and low prices that do not cover production costs - reduce consumer incentives to cut consumption. The diversity of end-users adds to the complexity of focused measures like energy-saving contracts. However, end-use sector reforms such as mandatory meter installation and increasing prices - even if socially acceptable and fully implemented - cannot alone provide the massive investments required. More appropriate is sector-wide reform with the government's financial participation - especially if consumer efforts can yield better service quality. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Heating sector; Modernization; Russia","Control structure; End-use sectors; End-users; End-uses; Future prospects; Management practices; Market share; Potential benefits; Production cost; Residential heating; Russia; Service Quality; Competition; Costs; Energy efficiency; Investments; Modernization; Quality of service; Heating; energy conservation; energy efficiency; heating; legislation; management practice; modernization; ownership; Russian Federation",,,,,,,03014215,,ENPYA,"English","Energy Policy",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856258701

Under Minkowski metric the feature weights become intuitively appealing feature rescaling factors in a conventional K-Means criterion. To see how this can be used in addressing another issue of K-Means, the initial setting, a method to initialize K-Means with anomalous clusters is adapted. The Minkowski metric based method is experimentally validated on datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and generated sets of Gaussian clusters, both as they are and with additional uniform random noise features, and appears to be competitive in comparison with other K-Means based feature weighting algorithms. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A key challenge in assessing WM in people with aphasia is related to the myriad deficits prevalent in aphasia, including deficits in attention, hearing, vision, speech, and motor control of the limbs. Eye-tracking methods augur well for developing alternative WM tasks and measures in that they enable researchers to address many of the potential confounds inherent in tasks traditionally used to study WM. Additionally, eye-tracking tasks allow investigation of trade-off patterns between storage and processing in complex span tasks, and provide on-line response measures.Aims: The goal of the study was to establish concurrent and discriminative validity of a novel eye movement WM task in individuals with and without aphasia. Additionally we aimed to explore the relationship between WM and general language measures, and determine whether trade-off between storage and processing is captured via eye-tracking measures.Methods & Procedures: Participants with (n = 28) and without (n = 32) aphasia completed a novel eye movement WM task. This task, incorporating natural response requirements, was designed to circumvent potential confounds due to concomitant speech, motor, and attention deficits. The task consisted of a verbal processing component intermixed with presentation of colours and symbols for later recall. Performance on this task was indexed solely via eye movements. Additionally, participants completed a modified listening span task that served to establish concurrent validity of the eye-tracking WM task.Outcomes & Results: Performance measures of the novel eye movement WM task demonstrated concurrent validity with another established measure of WM capacity: the modified listening span task. Performance on the eye-tracking task discriminated effectively between participants with and without aphasia. No consistent relationship was observed between WM scores and Western Aphasia Battery aphasia quotient and subtest scores for people with aphasia. Additionally, eye-tracking measures yielded no trade-off between processing and storage for either group of participants.Conclusions: Results support the feasibility and validity of employing a novel eye-tracking method to index WM capacity in participants with and without aphasia. Further research is required to determine the nature of the relationship between WM, as indexed through this method, and specific aspects of language impairments in aphasia. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Psychology Press, an imprint of the Taylor & Francis Group, an Informa business.","Aphasia; Cognitive processing; Complex span tasks; Eye-tracking; Working memory; Working memory assessment","adult; aged; aphasia; article; attention deficit disorder; controlled study; disease severity; eye movement; eye tracking; female; human; language disability; language processing; major clinical study; male; measurement; motor performance; speech; task performance; validity; verbal memory; visual deprivation; visual field defect; visual stimulation; working memory",,,,,,,02687038,,APHAE,"English","Aphasiology",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858213129

More severe runs on Sberbank outlets are found to be associated with more affluent and entrepreneurial regions, regions of more youthful and less educated population closer to Moscow, and areas with greater media freedom. Subsequent public opinion survey analysis of the socioeconomic correlates of runs on all Russian banks during the 1998 crisis reveals some interesting differences (in the effects of education in particular) on the propensity to successfully withdraw deposits.","1998 financial crisis; Bank runs; Household deposits; Ponzi scheme; Russia; Russian banks; Sberbank","banking; financial crisis; financial market; household survey; savings; Russian Federation",,,,,,,15387216,,,"English","Eurasian Geogr.

However, the height of large-amplitude solutions has a limit approaching which solitary waves widen and acquire a table like shape similar to soluitons of the Gardner equation. Numerical calculations confirm that the collision of solitons of the derived equation is inelastic. Inelasticity is the most pronounced in the interaction of unipolar pulses.

The implications of this perspective for evaluating the outcomes of such programmes are to be explored. Design/methodology/approach: The range of activities comprising foresight is reviewed, along with the various objectives that may underpin these activities. The more substantial foresight programmes are seen in terms of a series of steps, in each of which various partners can be involved in generating service outcomes and later steps of the process. The arguments are illustrated with insights drawn from various cases. Findings: A foresight programme is likely to feed into more than one policy process, so that the foresight activities can be linked to various stages of the policy cycles, as well as engaging participants with different degrees of influence on the policies in question. The outcomes of the foresight activity are also heavily shaped by the degree of involvement of various stakeholders, not least the sponsoring agency and any other groups it seeks to mobilise. Seeing foresight as a service activity brings to the fore the notion of co-production, and the importance of the design of the service encounters involved. Research limitations/implications: The task of evaluating foresight is a challenging one, and comparison of foresight activities needs to bear in mind the different scale, scope, and ambitions of different programmes. Simple static comparison of formal inputs and outputs will miss much of the value and value-added of the activity. Practical implications: A dynamic approach to evaluation stresses the learning of lessons about the roles of multiple stakeholders - and the responsibilities of sponsors as well as practitioners. Originality/value: Foresight programmes are frequently commissioned, and often have significant influence on decision-making. Attempts to systematically evaluate these efforts have begun, and this essay stresses the need to be aware of the complex interactive nature of foresight, highlighted by viewing it in service terms. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Evaluation; Foresight; Foresight programmes; Forward planning; Services; Stakeholders; Value added; Values",,,,,,,,14636689,,,"English","Foresight",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857580574

Yet whether respondents hold this view due to a preference for state property or concerns about the legitimacy of privatization is unclear. We test these arguments using a 2006 survey of 28,000 individuals in 28 post-communist countries and find that a lack of human capital affects support for revising privatization primarily via a preference for state property over private property; whereas transition-related hardships influence support for revising privatization due to both a preference for state property and concerns about the legitimacy of privatization. These results suggest the value of analyses that not only link respondent traits with support for policy, but that also probe the motivations that underpin this support.

Over the years, various recommender algorithms based on different mathematical models have been introduced in the literature. Researchers interested in proposing a new recommender model or modifying an existing algorithm should take into account a variety of key performance indicators, such as execution time, recall and precision. Till date and to the best of our knowledge, no general cross-validation scheme to evaluate the performance of recommender algorithms has been developed. To fill this gap we propose an extension of conventional cross-validation. Besides splitting the initial data into training and test subsets, we also split the attribute description of the dataset into a hidden and visible part. We then discuss how such a splitting scheme can be applied in practice. Empirical validation is performed on traditional user-based and item-based recommender algorithms which were applied to the MovieLens dataset. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","applied combinatorics; quality of recommendations; recommender systems; user-behavior modeling","Combinatorics; Cross validation; Cross-validation technique; Data sets; Empirical validation; Execution time; Key performance indicators; Recall and precision; Recommender algorithms; Research domains; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Benchmarking; Quality control; Recommender systems; Statistical tests; Mathematical models","Department of Science Technology (DST), Government of India;Department of Information Technology (DIT), Government of India;Counc.

In the asymptotic approach the nonlinearity leads to the generation of high-order harmonics in the propagating wave, which result in the wave breaking when the wave propagates shoreward, while within the perturbation theory besides wave deformation it leads to the variations in the mean sea level and wave reflection (waves do not reflect from ""non-reflecting"" beach in the linear theory). The nonlinear corrections (second harmonics) are calculated within both approaches and compared between each other. It is shown that for the wave propagating shoreward the nonlinear correction is smaller than the one predicted by the asymptotic approach, while for the offshore propagating wave they have a similar asymptotic. Nonlinear corrections for both waves propagating shoreward and seaward demonstrate the oscillatory character, caused by interference of the incident and reflected waves in the second-order perturbation theory, while there is no reflection in the linear approximation (first-order perturbation theory). Expressions for wave set-up and set-down along the non-reflecting beach are found and discussed. © Author(s) 2012.",,"beach; beach profile; nearshore dynamics; nonlinear wave; perturbation; sea level; theoretical study; wave propagation; wave reflection",,,,,,,10235809,,,"English","Nonlinear Processes Geophys.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855778696

The process considered is a rolling of round bar in roughing mill group which consist of four passes. The computer simulation of the process shows that the local plastic deformations which appear in the material are extremely large. This fact can leads to extension of surface defects. The dependences of maximum local plastic deformation on geometrical parameters of the calibres have been obtained and analysed during this study. The investigations performed, led to the development of new roll pass design which almost halved the maximum value of local plastic deformation in the material during the rolling. Since full 3D FEM models needs significant amount of computer memory and CPU time, it was not suitable for the performed study which involves a bulk of simulations with different initial conditions. Therefore, the quick algorithms for simulation of rolling processes which based on so-called ""2.5D"" method have been used. This method, due to number of simplifications, is significant faster then conventional 3D FEM, and at the same time it allows to reach good accuracy of the model. The developed computer software SPLEN(Rolling) which implements ""2.5D"" FEM simulations was applied for computations and analysis of the results. This software is able to predict the shape evolution of rolled material, as well as distributions of strain, strain rate and temperature within the volume of deformation zone. It has been shown that computer simulation based on ""2.5D"" FEM with SPLEN(Rolling) software can by efficiently used for optimization of technological procedures in rolling industry. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.","2.5D FEM; Computer simulation; Industrial hot rolling; Optimization; Roll pas design","3D FEM model; As distribution; Computer memories; CPU time; Deformation zone; FEM simulations; Geometrical parameters; Initial conditions; Local plastic deformation; Material behaviour; Maximum values; Quick algorithm; Roll pass design; Rolling process; Roughing mills; Shape evolution; Computational methods; Computer simulation; Design; Finite element method; Hot rolling; Materials; Optimization; Plastic deformation; Strain rate; Surface defects; Three dimensional; Computer software; Three dimensional computer graphics","The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society;Dynamic Systems Inc.

Thus, economic behavior of people who contribute a lot to social capital is more valuable for the society, too. Such people do not seek profits by unlawful means, as they are genuinely interested in economics and are more economically independent. This phenomenon is universal for representatives of both cultures surveyed. Most relations between social capital and various economic behavior patterns differ in nature across the two cultural groups. Similarities are only found in the classical dimension of social capital, which is trust. Interpersonal trust in both groups is negatively related to the willingness to accept the behavior pattern of prioritizing profit over the law and to the emotional component of prioritizing the size of remuneration over creative thinking at work. It has been found out that social capital prevents development of patterns of prioritizing profit over compliance with law and developing economic indifference in Russians. In Caucasians, social capital prevents developing economic paternalism (except for the intensiveness of civic identity). An analysis of the differences revealed in economic behavior patterns of the groups allows to suggest that they are caused by cultural contrasts.","Civic identity; Economic behavior patterns; Ethnic tolerance; Social capital; Trust",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Appearance of this term in discussion and information fields had two major circumstances in the background: a concentration of reform measures brought to spotlight by media; splashes of public debates, whether spontaneous or initiated by stakeholders. The paper shows how the frequency of using the term has been changing over the past decades. It became widespread in the early 1990s as denoting consistent education reform measures and has been subject to a number of semantic changes throughout the last 20 years, developing into a cliché. In 2010, this forgotten cliché was back in Russian sociocultural vocabulary, having acquired additional valence over the past few years. The author also investigates the meaning implied by this concept in journalistic texts, in particular in Obrazovatelnaya Politikaand Svobodnaya Mysljournals and in two collections of essays on history of education in Russia published in 2012. She suggests that frequency of use and semantics of the 'educational policy' cliché are the tools that help trace and analyze the nature and evolution of relations between authorities and the society.

The enhancement of HoG (Histogram of Gradients) algorithm with features mutual alignment is proposed to achieve better accuracy. The novel modification of directed enumeration method (DEM) using the ideas of the Best Bin First (BBF) search algorithm is introduced as an alternative to the nearest neighbor rule to prevent the brute force. We present the results of an experimental study in a problem of face recognition with FERET and Essex datasets. We compare the performance of our DEM modification with conventional BBF k-d trees in their well-known efficient implementation from OpenCV library. It is shown that the proposed method is characterized by increased computing efficiency (2-12 times in comparison with BBF) even in the most difficult cases where many neighbors are located at very similar distances.

The experiments were performed in two stages: the stepped tensile-tests series (temperature range 700-925 °C) and the constant strain rate tensile-test series (temperature range 775-925 °C). By the results of stepped tensile tests the constitutive equations which describe relationship between stress and strain rate for each temperature were constructed. On the base of obtained data, the temperature and strain rate ranges which ensure the realization of superplasticity at forming of Ti-6Al-4V alloy as well as optimal strain rates which corresponds to the maximum value of strain rate sensitivity exponent m were determined. It was shown that at low temperatures (700-775°C) the Ti-6Al-4V alloy shows all signs of superplasticity, however at these temperatures the optimal strain rates are too slow for industrial technological procedures. The dependence between optimum strain rate and reciprocal temperature appears to be well fitted by exponential low. At the second stage of the experimental research, the tensile-tests with a constant, optimum for each temperature strain rate were carried in order, to estimate the real initial flow stress and the character of strain hardening of the material during the deformation with optimum strain rate. In was found that flow stress values obtained by stepped tensile tests matches the values form constant-strain-rate tests with effective strain value equal to 0.2 and the strain hardening during the deformation with optimal strain rates is significant.","Constitutive model; Superplasticity; Tensile-tests; Titanium alloy","Alloys; Aluminum; Constitutive equations; Constitutive models; Deformation; Hardening; Plastic flow; Strain hardening; Stress-strain curves; Superplasticity; Tensile testing; Titanium; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Constant strain rate tests; Experimental investigations; Experimental research; Reciprocal temperature; Strain rate sensitivity exponent; Stress and strain rate; Superplastic behavior; Ti-6al-4v titanium alloys; Strain rate","","TANGER Ltd.","21st International Conference on Metallurgy and Materials, METAL 2012","23 May 2012 through 25 May 2012",,110526,,9788087294314,,"English","METAL - Conf.

They explain why the modern 'model' of a graduate doesn't contribute to formation of state identity, the key components of which (cognitive, emotional and evaluative, normative-value, and behavioral) are largely disintegrated. The efforts made to increase young people's knowledge of the state and to develop their idea of what is due and right don't actually change their behavior towards the state, while demonstration of a certain level of knowledge is neutralized by distrust to the existing political realities, which results in treating the state much as an external enemy. Today, higher education is still focused on producing qualified professionals demanded in the labor market, but not citizens who would develop and support the state they live and work in. The function of developing civic identity is almost entirely restricted to secondary schools and disappears as soon as children leave them. However, state and citizenship are absolutely valuable for young people today, although they don't always realize it. Moreover, an absolute value is conveyed by their own state, as it provides a perception of community which, on the one hand, sets very strict limits of the difference between 'us and them', while, on the other hand, accepting other identities and granting necessary freedom to an individual. Nevertheless, these normative-value attitudes are not supported by cognitive or behavioral ones.","'model' of a graduate; Civic identity; Higher education; National identity; State identity",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Four target groups are investigated to determine drivers of internal transformations in universities in response to fundamental changes from the outside. These groups are: university administrators, students, graduates, and employers. An analysis of empirical data has revealed that in general, stakeholders positively assess the quality of education in Russian universities. The only unsatisfied group is employers who are not happy with the level of graduates applying for job as they lack specific knowledge and practical skills. Sociological questionnaires conducted over the last fifteen years have proved that employers are consistently unsatisfied with the quality of higher vocational education. An analysis of final year students' self-assessment has evidenced that they lack desperately competencies required for a successful career in today's economy. As the authors suggest, academic experience of students does not include learning activities that help develop such competencies. Sticking to the idea of engagement and the theory of concerned students, the authors argue that most Russian universities interact with students through an unspoken ""disengagement compact"", where each party accepts the existing situation as the most comfortable one and refuses to change anything.

The conditions of superplasticity are very sensitive to strain rates and temperature characteristic of deformation process. The presented work gives an approach to design the SPF technologies that satisfies such conditions.A possibility to decrease the temperature of the industrial forming of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy is considered.On the basis of experimental data obtained the three-dimensional computer approximation of mechanical characteristics of Ti-6Al-4V alloy was constructed. It was made in a broad range of temperatures and strain rate, taking account of strain hardening and structure parameter affect. Tension tests of workpieces were carried on up to the destruction. Laboratory studies of the material mechanical properties show that the temperature of industrial superplastic forming can be lowered. A developed mathematical model is proposed and enables to calculate an optimum pressurization taking into account the structural state of the shell material and principles of the shell friction on the die surface.The calculated pressurization enables to obtain the optimum superplastic properties of the material in the preset area of the deformed shell.The proposed model has been tested experimentally. In laboratory conditions, forming of special workpieces with calculated pressurization has been conducted. The experimental researchers confirm theoretical forecasts concerning an ability to decrease the forming temperature of Ti-6Al-4VSPF.According to the designed method the theoretical forecasts of industrial shells formchanging in flight vehicles were computerised. The calculation for optimization of manufacturing parts of a jet plane flanks apply a method of superplastic gaseous forming compatible with a diffusion boundary is implemented.","Fem; Optimization; Sheet forming; Strain-rate control; Superplasticity","Aluminum; Finite element method; Mechanical properties; Optimization; Pressurization; Strain hardening; Superplasticity; Tensile testing; Titanium alloys; Design and optimization; Laboratory conditions; Mechanical characteristics; Sheet forming; Strain-rate control; Superplastic forming; Superplastic properties; Temperature characteristic; Strain rate","","TANGER Ltd.","21st International Conference on Metallurgy and Materials, METAL 2012","23 May 2012 through 25 May 2012",,110526,,9788087294314,,"English","METAL - Conf.

A distinctive feature of these studies is their interdisciplinary nature, as they combine theories and methods of different social sciences. To identify mechanisms of interrelation between education and social capital, three levels of interaction are examined: family (microlevel), local communities (mezolevel), and the country as a whole (macrolevel). It appears that social capital at the family and local community levels is an important factor of boosting the educational level and the accessibility of high quality education. At theDF microlevel, social capital explains most variations in academic performance, even with regard to financial and human capital of parents. Moreover, social capital in families determines efficiency of spending on education. At the mezolevel, social capital improves academic performance and raises chances of getting higher education as a result of intense parent-teacher and parent-parent communication. Close social ties of families provide them with access to institutional resources (graduate communities, engagement in academic milieu, etc.) which may become valuable social assets. Empirical studies at the macrolevel have revealed that education, in its turn, has positive external effects, such as building trust, learning civic norms, or engaging more actively in public and political life. That is, effects of education are not limited to economic returns. Education plays a powerful role, being both the result and the factor of social capital accumulation at different levels.","Civic norms; Education; External effects; Social capital; Tolerance; Trust",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Respondents have a fairly clear idea of the public needs and requirements. This idea may be realized either as a civic initiative or as a social enterprise. A survey of practices applied in such organizations has shown that a home-based kindergarten is a self-sustaining project, while its financing is rather characteristic of a civic initiative. An analysis of relationships between owners of home-based kindergartens has revealed no exchange of information or experience, which is typical of both civic initiatives and entrepreneurship, for different reasons. The author evaluates prospects of developing home-based kindergartens as a form of social entrepreneurship. She also determines their potential to solve social problems of the modern Russian society, such as overcoming the lack of kindergarten places or providing employment for specific population groups. Under favorable conditions, home-based kindergartens may serve a good source of unique preschool methods and programs. The paper proves that home-based kindergartens are now much closer to civic initiatives than to social enterprises.

We propose a hidden Markov chain model to analyze structural changes and apply it to the Russian stock market. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2012.",,,,"Springer International Publishing",,,,,19316828,,,"English","Springer Optim.

Five formal patterns of Jussive are attested in these languages, including a specialized form, constructions derived from 'want', from 'tell him to do' and from 'make him do' and the Optative. Jussive forms may express such meanings as third person command, indirect causation, permission, indifference towards the accomplishment of an action and an assumption. While the Jussive is crucially different from the second person Imperative in that it introduces a third participant, this article shows that it is the addressee, not a third person, who is the central participant of a Jussive situation from both formal and functional points of view. © Walter de Gruyter.",,,,,,,,,00243949,,,"English","Linguistics",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856894820

The research of educational, migration and career strategies of rural high school students, as well as of factors underlying these strategies, is based on an empirical model of intergenerational social mobility which reveals the way elements of social and cultural environment influence formation of life trajectories. The research used results of a total survey of rural schools in five regions of Russia differing in climatic, environmental and transport conditions, levels and patterns of socioeconomic development, demographic trends, and types of rural settlements. All regions involved in the survey evidenced absolute prevalence of the strategies to continue learning, mostly in higher education institutions or in colleges, and then to get a job in the city. As rural students find the 'social parachute' educational, career and migration strategies very attractive and workable, Russia might soon suffer a significant drain of youth from the country to the city and another wave of urbanization. Early admission to labor and chances to inherit parents' business are the only factors that can correct the overwhelming aspiration of rural high school students to get higher education and to move to the city and make them stay in the country.","Career plans; Educational strategies; Intergenerational mobility; Life trajectories; Migration from the country to the city; Migration trajectories; Rural education; Rural school; Social mobility",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

The first difference method was used to determine how teacher characteristics were correlated with student achievements and to overcome restrictions of TIMSS correlation design. In addition, effects of teacher characteristics were evaluated by the conventional regression analysis. The discovered correlations differed across subject areas, and the results of the first difference method differed from those of the conventional correlation analysis. In mathematics, the first difference method revealed negative relation between academic progress and rule-based tasks or collaborative learning, while tasks designed to develop meta-subject skills showed a positive effect on performance. In natural sciences, on the contrary, rule-based tasks showed positive relation, while tasks designed to develop meta-subject skills produced a negative effect or no effect at all. Unlike in mathematics, teacher experience also had a significant influence on student achievements in natural sciences. Implementing the new methodological approach has allowed not only to determine relation between teacher characteristics and academic performance of students but also to identify characteristics typical of specific teacher categories, as, for example, those who work in elite schools or teach better-prepared students. This information may be used both in developing the educational policy and in designing future studies, especially experimental ones.","Cognitive development; First difference method; Mathematics; Meta-subject skills; Professional experience; School students; Teachers; TIMSS",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Foresight has made a transition from thematic papers and policy briefs to a complex set of methods integrated in the framework of S&T and innovation policy making. Foresight also addresses broad social and economic issues along with conventional S&T problems. It focuses often on interdisciplinary fields and cross-sector problems. It has witnessed the introduction of such new methods as weak signals and wild cards, and it has benefitted from the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Russian S&T foresight follows global trends. It has given support for revisions of the national S&T priorities and critical technologies. In 2007-2010, two cycles of the National S&T Foresight (initiated by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation) were completed. They resulted in the creation of frameworks and expert networks for future studies. Foresight culture has been finding deeper roots in Russia. The paper addresses mainly the key features of the third (ongoing) cycle of the national S&T Foresight (2011) against the background of the first two cycles and the international trends. This cycle represents a wider coverage of issues (macroeconomic scenarios, trends in basic research, S&T resources, future dem and for skills, and global drivers of S&T developments); more complicated methodologies (bibliometric analysis, expert panels, surveys, roadmapping, and quantitative models); and a combination of ""market pull"" and ""technology push"" approaches toward estimating future developments. This cycle is building a wider network of experts at new Foresight centres at various Russian research universities. It concludes with a discussion of some barriers still to be overcome in Foresight studies: integration of sectoral visions, deeper analyses of some scientific disciplines, stronger integration into policy making, and spreading among business and research communities.","Critical technologies; Decision-making; Foresight; Long-term forecasting; National innovation system; Roadmapping; Russian long-term S&T foresight; S&T priorities",,,"National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics",,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884504469

It seems, on one hand, that there are few cases of systematic and successful cluster creation from the ground up. Onanother, clusters shaped without any contribution from government are difficult to find. In this sense, the empirical evidence will not readily provide an answer to the questions, how much intervention is needed and are the existing tools adequate for creating clusters. The author analyses two basic types of market failures related to shaping anddevelopment of clusters. These are a mismatch of territorial location of production forces to existing centrifugal and centripetal agglomeration effects (positive and negative external gains, as well as underproduction of a positive external gain that influences performance of local actors). The paper also concerns possible causes, where public cluster policy produces inefficiencies (government failures). That is, it analyses the most obvious risks for policy implementation. It is argued that an efficient policy should be aimed at dealing with market failures, while the procedures and implementing algorithms - at overcoming government failures.","Cluster policy; Government failures; Location of productive forces; Market failures",,,"National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics",,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886558124

The study is based on a survey conducted in autumn 2010 among first-year university students and their parents in sixteen major Russian cities. Family income has proved to have a positive effect on performance in major USE subjects. This relationship remains statistically significant even for students who had similar academic achievements before starting to prepare for entrance exams, i.e. just after the 9th grade. High school graduates ultimately differ in their academic progress, as their families have different financial resources to invest in additional preparation for entrance exams. The average passing score is used to describe universities admitting candidates with similar USE points but different family incomes. Candidates from higher income families with satisfactory and good USE results manage their points more efficiently than candidates with the same results from lower income families. The revealed positive effect of family income on academic achievements of high school graduates, on the strategies of preparing for entrance exams, and on the quality of higher education programs means that establishment of USE as a unified examination, or standardized testing, did not provide equal access to higher education for different categories of high school graduates.","Academic performance; Choice of university; Family income; School; Unified state exam",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

The author identifies and describes the key approaches to analyze the history of Russian education that are largely based on modernization processes: the hermeneutic approach, the anthropological pass-through approach, and the conventionally impressionist approach. The prevailing trends in research of the history of Russian education are analyzed using the dilogy on the life journey of Yuliya Fausek (née Andrusova), where all the abovementioned approaches are used to represent the same historical material from different perspectives. The author describes cultural and historical background for the adoption of two European preschool education philosophies, Froebel's and Montessori's, in the early 19th century in Russia, and specifies their fundamental principles that formed the basis for ideological antagonism among Russian adherents. She also investigates biographical prerequisites for Yuliya Fausek's commitment to Montessori's theory and describes the tragic effects of her activities on disseminating teaching policies inconsistent with the communist ideology. By analyzing the publishing and research practices applied in the book, the author describes typical perversions of facts.

An analysis of enrolment rates allows to predict that reduction in the number of part-time students that started in 2010 is likely to progress. In general, changes in part-time education are quite consistent with the overall trend towards lower enrolment rates. It is curious that the number of part-time students began to reduce a few years ago. Before that, it had been growing, despite continuously decreasing full-time and overall enrolment rates. A comparison of part-time enrolment rates to those of part-time student graduation has shown that the latter have been consistently growing. The authors have revealed how the number of part-time students is determined by changes in the private vocational education system. In addition to the overall trend, the number of part-time students had reduced by the 2010-2011 academic year due to elimination of unlicensed private education institutions, which led to a cut-down in part-time places. The newly introduced forms of higher education (Bachelor's and Master's degrees) are poorly correlated with part-time education at the moment, especially in national and municipal educational institutions. Fields of study and professions have been classified according to the proportion of part-time students in the total student population. Finally, gender- and age-related characteristics of part-time students have been described.","Enrolment of students; Field of study; Gender- and age-related characteristics; Higher vocational education; Number of students; Part-time education; Private higher vocational education; State and municipal higher vocational institutions",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

The period from 2004, when an administrative reform was launched and when the united Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation was formed, until the spring of 2012, when there was a change of government, witnessed a shift in powers from the legislative to the executive branch and from regional to federal authorities. Such a significant shift in educational powers from regional to federal authorities violates the very essence of federalism where powers should be separated in order to find appropriate solutions for each specific region and situation. Educational policy has been deregionalized lately, making it too hard for the center to cope with its powers. As a result, the center suggests standard solutions when they are totally inappropriate. Thus, the shift in powers and its practical effects have produced two essential educational phenomena: the low level of trust between federal and regional authorities, and the low independence of regional authorities. Challenges and risks of centralization of powers are investigated through specific examples of management practices. The author analyzes the solutions to centralization of powers proposed by different authorities and offers solutions of his own. He also argues that we need to find and trigger the mechanisms of promoting the feedback between people and regional and municipal authorities.","Constitution; Education management; Federalism; Powers; Scope of powers; Separation of powers",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

It appears that applicants and their families have changed strategies of choosing a university and of pre-entry training since the USE was made compulsory. Now, more families choose to apply to several institutions, and less only opt for one. Besides, as the USE is compulsory, more and more applicants attend pre-entry courses at school or prepare on their own rather than attending courses in higher education institutions. These results are consistent across different income and demographic status of families, regardless of the city. Effects of the reform tend to be irregular. The most important changes in strategies of choosing a university and of pre-entry training have been found in lower income families. After the reform was started, children in these families began attending pre-entry training in more subjects and attempting to enter more than one university. As a result, they have been appraising their own knowledge of school program much higher and feeling much more confident while preparing for the USE. Thus, pre-training courses have boosted the chances of entering a university for children from low income families. The conclusion is that applicants from lower income families benefit more than other applicants from the compulsory USE.","Admission strategies; Affordability of higher education; Education reform; Higher education institutions; United State Exam",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Strategies of increasing work efficiency and improving educational results in schools have become part of national educational policies in many countries. The underlying concept of these strategies is the recognition of the close relation between low socioeconomic status of student families and low teaching results of schools. As a rule, educational policies include measures to identify the risk segments and to provide timely interventions so as to avoid acute or chronic inefficiency. In some rare, extremely difficult cases, education management authorities resort to more drastic measures, from change of management and part of the teaching staff to reorganization of the whole educational institution. Modern support programs for low-performing schools around the world are based on consistent and large-scale launching of financial, staff, organizational and other mechanisms designed to enhance qualification and stimulate professional growth of teachers, to expand the culture of collaboration, co-research and distribution of effective practices among teachers, to allocate leadership roles in school management, to develop partner relations between principals of the highest and the lowest performing schools, and to implement the efficient school model largely in practice. The international experience of research and practical interventions into this field may be useful for Russian education, especially now when support of low-performing schools is on the agenda of Russian educational policy.","Education reform; Funding; Low-performing schools; National programs; Schools working in challenging social contexts; Testing",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

The study enabled to reveal transformation of the professional education market, its transition from expansion to contraction. Nowadays, the professional education market is changing under the influence of multidirectional trends determined by factors external to education, such as population decline, decrease in effective demand, employer dissatisfaction with education quality, and lower student motivation to continue education. In this context, the basic vector for development quite naturally involves structural optimization, merging educational institutions of different levels, diversification of funding sources, and change in higher education management system. In the contraction phase of the market, an adequate restructuring policy can result in consistent structural transformation. However, neither experts nor the society have yet reached a compromise on these issues, which dooms the optimization course to protests and opposition from the professional community, parents and employers.","Consumer spending; Educational services market; Funding; Higher education; Public demand",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Depending on the degree of novelty of the transferred technologies there are three identified segments of scientific organizations manifesting one of the following behavioral patterns: innovation (introduction of developments that are unique both in domestic and foreign markets, and feature qualitatively new characteristics matching or surpassing current standards), modification (introduction of technologies new to the implementing organization, although not to the market and adaptation (modification and improvement of technology previously used by the implementing organization). Analyzing the key features of research organizations allows composing an average depiction of separate segments. The study reveals significant differences between these segments in their methods and means of technology transfer and required public support mechanisms.

Analysis of empirical data is used to discuss ethnic and social differentiation of schools, interaction between parents and schools, attitude of parents towards students of different ethnicity, and interethnic communication among students. It has been found out that children are distributed across schools according to their social status rather than to their ethnicity. The authors confirm the American sociologist theory of positive immigrant selection and first-generation immigrant optimism. The same effects in Russia are explained by the late beginning of mass immigration, which makes them likely to vanish in the next generation. Using multilevel regression models, the authors demonstrate how migration status and ethnicity influence academic performance. Children from minority immigrant families have proved to be highly motivated, while their academic achievements are as good as those of their native classmates, and aspirations for higher education are much the same in both ethnic minority and majority students. An analysis of social links in schools has revealed no discrimination against ethnic minority students, despite nationalist trends in the Russian society.","Differentiation of schools; Immigration; Language adaptation; School education; Social links",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

However, when strategizing the organization is often regarded as a single whole, differences in aims and areas of operation of its parts not being considered. This approach works for many organizations, but in the case of a distributed structure its parts may function in the markets which have different requirements, competition intensity and qualification of consumers. Besides, the departments of that organization may have different levels of development. In our present work we do not consider the whole range of distributed organizations, but concentrate on universities, as they have common characteristics with commercial organizations and, at the same time, are very specific in their rules and areas of development. We focus on developing a new modeling method for decision support while designing a balanced hierarchical strategy for distributed universities. This implies beginning from the strategy for the whole organization and moving on to development of individual strategies for its departments. Thus, the proposed method contains two parts: a sub-method to develop departmental strategies and a sub-method to calculate interaction among departments. This article describes the proposed structure and semantics of the model which can be used in the both of sub-methods.","Business process modeling; DEMO; Distributed organization; Distributed university; Organizational structure; Simulation modeling","Computer simulation; Decision support systems; Information science; Management science; Semantics; Societies and institutions; Systems engineering; Business process model; DEMO; Distributed organizations; Distributed university; Organizational structures; Planning","","CEUR-WS","11th International Conference on Perspectives in Business Informatics Research, BIR 2012","24 September 2012 through 26 September 2012",,111256,16130073,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924337549

To a certain extent, this variability has been defined by the Russian economy, which in the 1990s passed through a stage of deep structural transformation and severe financial crisis, but which then benefited from a period of fast and mainly stable economic growth in the first years of the twenty-first century. Now, the serious economic decline as a result of the global crisis of 2008-2009 has been replaced by an unstable and uncertain recovery. In the 2000s a very specific political regime of personalized power under Vladimir Putin-set to be back as president in 2012-was established in Russia. During his next term Putin will face the most serious challenges to Russia's economic policy yet. According to some scenarios, these challenges could significantly destabilize the country's politics and economy. Russia is facing a demographic trap; the ageing of the population is increasing the pension burden on the budget, while the shrinking labour force will surely become an obstacle to growth. The dependence of the budget and balance of payments on the price of oil has grown so great that even price stabilization becomes a threat to macroeconomic stability. The poor quality of the investment climate leads to falling private investment which, in turn, hinders the much-vaunted modernization of the economy. If combined, these problems will lead to the widening of the gap in technology and living standards between Russia and developed countries. Elimination of political competition and the impossibility of replacing political leaders through elections have led to widespread corruption and abuses, crony capitalism, and the complete undermining of the independence of the courts and law enforcement which further complicates the search for adequate responses to the mounting economic challenges. As there are no reasons to believe that Vladimir Putin is going to reform the country's current political system, the gradual accumulation of economic problems could well become the main threat to his presidency as Russia heads towards 2020. © 2012 The Author(s).

Understanding the demand and supply of engineers' skills is important for modernization policies, and it is also important to know how to measure skill absorption by employees. Based on empirical data, the study evaluates the skill levels and absorption capacities of Russian engineers to measure what knowledge they can mobilize to resolve professional tasks. It constructs profiles of the different categories of engineering personnel. It compares demand and supply of engineering skills in Russia and EU countries in five categories: use of professional knowledge, individual performance, team work, managerial and communication skills. The analysis shows significant distinctions among compared countries. To summarize, the level of general and special competencies for Russian engineers is well below what is required by their workplace. The contrary can be said about their European counterparts, who have the required skills. Serious discrepancies between Russian and European engineers (favouring Europeans) are observed for organization and coordination skills, team work, effective use of time, ability to evaluate critically their own and others' ideas, use the computer and the Internet for professional purposes. The availability of specialized engineering skills alone is insufficient in today's job market: employers expect a more proactive approach by the engineers, including the promotion of the products. In view of various ""distortions"" in the training of engineers, not only in Russia but also in other countries, where the patterns of portfolios in the labour market do not match the demand for them, the possession of social skills is of particular value.","Competences; Engineering personnel; Innovation economy; S&T personnel; Skills; Vocational education",,,"National Research University",,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897010358

The empirical basis is the first phase of the longitudinal project 'Monitoring educational and employment trajectories of school and higher education institution graduates' launched by NRU HSE in 2010 to explore educational and professional trajectories of Russian high school students throughout several years. Family capital has turned out to be interrelated with the type of school attended by children. It has been revealed that students attending specialized schools and gymnasiums come from families with largest family capitals. Inequality in financial resources of families is exacerbated by territorial differences in educational opportunities. In general, family capital factors affect educational opportunities of school students, but their already existing achievements and investments in human capital are affected more than educational aspirations. The latter are rather determined by the type of school, academic progress, extra-curricular activities, and the child's personal traits and efforts. The fact that family capital factors do not influence educational aspirations significantly is in conflict with a number of earlier studies. The contradiction is supposed to be related with high uncertainty of educational aspirations in 9th grade students.","Educational aspirations; Educational opportunities; Family capital; Higher education",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

An opinion poll conducted among schools graduates (9th and 11th grades) and students of vocational technical schools, colleges and higher education institutions has revealed heterogeneity of post-secondary education: there is no single 'place market' in this education, no single differentiation system which would enable professional education institutions of different types to 'scan' academic performance of candidates. As institutions of each type have their own codes for candidate selection, educational choice of school students is not restricted to choosing an education institution; it also involves choosing the right code recognizable by professional education institution of a specific type. That is why, when the Unified State Exam (USE) was made a universal code for all HE institutions, educational choice of students not interested in higher education was shifted in time from the 11th grade to the 9th grade, as the USE code was not used when applying to vocational technical schools or colleges. By contrast, nearly all 11th graders (90%) are going to apply to HE institutions only-they already made their choice of code when they decided to take the USE.

While analyzing the law studies differentiation plans, the authors reveal the main reasons for this differentiation. These are: a) the need to eliminate defects of the fundamental model of legal education, and b) the need to provide a candidate pool not only for judicial authorities but also for the government system. The lack of professors is believed to be one of the key factors of unsuccessful attempts to introduce differentiation. As a result, differentiation of disciplines among different faculty departments was distorted, and some disciplines were even discarded from learning schedules. All of this brought discredit on the very concept of differentiation. Students favored the governmental department much less than the legal one, as the latter promised broader career opportunities. Attempts to divide law faculties into departments owed their failure to the absence of a smooth professional training mechanism in the Russian Empire. As graduates from different departments did not differ in their skills, specialists were not distributed among judiciary authorities and the government system in compliance with qualifications they had acquired, which augmented the risk of employing incompetent people. The practices proposed by Moscow University in the early 19th century have been adopted by modern legal education, which implies differentiation at the second stage of the two-stage educational system.","Differentiation between learning programs; Faculty of law; Legal education; Universities",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Classification can be performed using supervised or unsupervised methods. From the unsupervised point of view, Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) can be used for such a task in an efficient and well-founded way. From the supervised point of view, emerging patterns rely on pattern mining and can be used to characterize classes of objects w.r.t. a priori labels. In this paper, we present a hybrid classification method which is based both on supervised and unsupervised aspects. This method relies on FCA for building a concept lattice and then detects the concepts whose extents determines classes of objects sharing the same labels. These classes can then be used as reference classes for classifying unknown objects. This hybrid approach has been used in an experiment in chemistry for classifying inhibitors of the c-Met protein which plays an important role in protein interactions and in the development of cancer. © 2012 by the paper authors.","Emerging patterns; Formal Concept Analysis; Pattern mining; Supervised classification; Unsupervised classification","Classification (of information); Data mining; Information analysis; Proteins; Emerging patterns; Formal concept analyses (FCA); Hybrid classification; Pattern mining; Protein interaction; Supervised classification; Unsupervised classification; Unsupervised method; Formal concept analysis","","CEUR-WS","9th International Conference on Concept Lattices and Their Applications, CLA 2012","11 October 2012 through 14 October 2012",,110577,16130073,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922692536

It is important that mass communication, with its virtual product is related to two other sectors: telecommunications and information and communication technology. Technological transformations affect these three industries alike; the growth of bandwidth, convergence of terminals and growth of their computational performance are transforming products and markets in all three. Long-term trends in these markets have been well defined by a range of industrial experts. The conclusion of the paper provides recommendations for the revision of public policy. The authors note only a few new tendencies in services and products. However, wide diffusion of these trends due to cheap technologies will lead to radical changes in the sector. New markets will appear as a result of expansion and adjustment of industrial relations between agents, previously independent of each other. Key trends are the abandonment of linear-media in favor of ""user-controlled"" consumption, with a growing amount of content produced by the user, and the spread of social interactions. The trends are interrelated and determine the transformation of business models, the sources of income, and the value of goods produced by the media industry. The most negative trend according to experts is ""deprofessionalization"" of content, which poses a risk for institutionalized forms of media. With such turbulent changes regulation in mass communications will inevitably undergo transformation. Henceforth it will not be able to rely upon content filtering and setting quotas. Instead the regulation should be built upon enabling a diversity of information sources to create the news agenda at the request of the audience.","Content; Foreñasting; Information technologies; Long-term trends; Mass communications; Media market; Scenario analysis",,,"National Research University",,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884520189

Vocational education is regarded as an investment in human capital. As the competency building approach puts it, efficiency of education is achieved when educational results can satisfy the economic needs. The authors discuss the possibility of efficient integration of the educational system into the modern economic system. They also describe changes in education required for such integration and factors that prevent it. Priority measures to eliminate the latter are determined. Commissioning of educational services has changed quite a lot for the last two decades. Governmental and social control over the ultimate educational results has been getting progressively stricter. New educational programs have been emerging at the intersection of higher and secondary education. Education is believed to be an instrument of social stratification. The authors reveal the major trends in its development, which are about dividing educational programs into traditional and exclusively vocational, and about creating programs to provide qualified contractors. BAS programs have some distinct advantages, as they satisfy the demands of all educational market players - the government, the society, the candidates, and their parents. A new type of university is about to emerge - the elite university designed for the most talented students from affluent families. Rendering educational services comfortable for all players and customers of the process is claimed to be the paramount condition and criterion of education quality and the top priority goal of education modernization.","Competency building approach; Educational programs; Educational standards; Higher education; Individual education customer; Professional standards; Vocational education",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

It is noted that this approach may lead to a computationally intractable solution. An alternative approach based on computing closure of subsets of object intent is considered. The alternative approach allows one to find a polynomial time algorithm and to deal with inconsistent combination of attributes.

As a result the different rates discount cash flows invested in the project and generated by the project. The GNPV method allows us to consider any non-conventional project as an investment as a loan. Thus, each non-conventional project always has two rates of return: GIRR(p) and GERR(r) depending on the reinvestment and finance rates, respectively.

The intersection of the attractor with some invariant submanifold does not coincide with the attractor of the restriction of the skew product to this submanifold but contains this restriction as a proper subset. Moreover, this intersection is thick on the submanifold, that is, both the intersection and its complement have positive relative measure. Such an intersection is called a bone, and the attractor itself is said to be bony. These attractors are studied in the space of skew products. They have the important property that, on some open subset of the space of skew products, the set of maps with such attractors is, in a certain sense, prevalent, i. e., ""big.""

This excitation occurs as a result of a succession of processes: a modulation of the plasma density by acoustic-gravity waves in the ionosphere, a reflection of the whistlers by ionosphere modulation, and a modification of whistler wave generation in the magnetospheric resonator. A variation of the magnetospheric resonator Q-factor has an influence on the operation of the plasma magnetospheric maser, where the active substances are radiation belt particles, and the working modes are electromagnetic whistler waves. The magnetospheric maser is an oscillating system which can be responsible for the excitation of self-oscillations. These self-oscillations are frequently characterized by alternating stages of accumulation and precipitation of energetic particles into the ionosphere during a pulse of whistler emissions. Numerical and analytical investigations of the response of self-oscillations to harmonic oscillations of the whistler reflection coefficient shows that even a small modulation rate can significantly change magnetospheric VLF emissions. Our results can explain the causes of the modulation of energetic electron fluxes and whistler wave intensity with a time scale from 10 to 150 s in the day-side magnetosphere. Such quasi-periodic VLF emissions are often observed in the sub-auroral and auroral magnetosphere and have a noticeable effect on the formation of space weather phenomena.

The characteristic wave height varies with depth according to Green's law, and this follows rigorously from the theoretical model. The skewness and kurtosis are computed, and it is shown that they grow when the depth decreases, and simultaneously the wave state deviates from the Gaussian. The probability of large-amplitude (rogue) waves increases within the transition zone. The characteristics of this process depend on the wave steepness, which is characterized in terms of the Ursell parameter. The obtained results show that the number of rogue waves may deviate significantly from the value expected for a flat bottom of a given depth. Evolution of waves propagating onshore is studied by means of numerical simulations of two different depth-dependent models. The depth and wave conditions correspond to buoys situated in the vicinity of Taiwanese coast, and records of rogue waves retrieved by them. The simulations inform about the change of wave appearance while they approach the coast, evolution of spectral and statistical characteristics. The reconstruction helps to answer the essential question about the lifetime of rogue waves; this is a poorly studied issue, which desires particular study with use of natural data.

With tensed verb forms, the speaker can refer to the past (wrote, has written), present (writes, is writing) or future (will write). Reference to the past through verb morphology has been shown to be particularly vulnerable in agrammatic aphasia (Bastiaanse, 2008; Yarbay Duman & Bastiaanse, 2009) and both agrammatic and non-brain-damaged individuals have longer RTs with verb forms referring to the past than with verb forms referring to the present (Faroqi-Shah & Dickey, 2009). It has been argued that these results are due to the discourse-linking nature of past tense (Bastiaanse et al., 2011). This article reports ERP and behavioral (reaction time and acceptability rating) data on the processing of time reference violations in which verb forms do not match a time frame previously set by an adverb (present adverb-past tense verb; past adverb-present tense verb). The results show that violation by a present tense verb yields a P600 time-locked to the verb. No such response is found for violation by a past tense verb. These ERP results are similar to ERP findings on locally bound and discourse-linked pronominal processing and when related to behavioral findings on identical violations, support the claim that in present tense processing co-reference is established with the speech time (local binding), while past tense processing involves co-reference with some other event time (discourse-linking). © 2011 Elsevier Inc..","Discourse-linking; Language processing; P600; Sentence-final negativity; Tense; Time reference",,,,,,,,0749596X,,,"English","J.

According to international practice, developing a cluster strategy is an important step towards building a fully-fledged innovation policy toolkit; moreover it gives evidence of a well thought out long-term approach by government to overall development of territories and economic sectors. At present the Russian government has moved from conceptual frameworks to implementation of specific cluster initiatives. However using tools that have originated abroad in the Russian context requires a thorough analysis of intrinsic barriers reducing the efficiency of innovation development programmes. Direct borrowing of institutions and mechanisms from practices of leading countries rarely leads to desired outcomes. While using even advanced policy tools it is important to take into account specifics of the target environment, pay a special attention to details, not only to general frameworks and principles of incorporated institutes. The main aim of this paper is to find and rationalize key success factors for the emerging national system of supporting regional clusters.

The authors show the mechanics of descriptive languages in research with specific examples from their own empirical projects. Assuming that theoretical foundation-conceptual definitions and research hypotheses-is based on non-theoretical, or pre-theoretical, factors, the authors demonstrate connection between scientific concepts and their pre-theoretical basis. Using the metaphor theory to explicate axiomatic assumptions, they regard sociological studies as a series of 'translations' between mutually impenetrable linguistic worlds (the world of common sense, the world of sociological theory, the world of management decisions). The paper discovers transition points where research acquires or loses its strictly scientific nature. Purely scientific methods are only used for conceptualization, development of tools and data interpretation. Basic metaphors (the axiomatic level) are rather associated with intuition and imagination, field data collection has to do with the logic of common sense, while managing skills and development of recommendations belong to the sphere of management. Methodological implications of metaphorical shifts and effects of an 'uncontrolled metaphorical expansion' are discussed in the paper. The authors study in detail the metaphors of organism and market as applied to education. As implicit expansion (transfer of properties from auxiliary object to main object) is the fundamental property of metaphor, the authors believe that explication of research metaphors may facilitate significantly solving the problem of 'translation' between different 'realities' of the research process.","An uncontrolled metaphorical expansion effect; Axiom; Economic metaphor of education; Explication; Metaphor; Organicistic metaphor of education; Paradox; Sociological studies; Sociology of education; Tautology",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

The study of these disorders reflects the history of Russian neuropsychology and is dominated by the syndrome approach most notably by the writings of Luria. Indeed, our understanding of acquired dysgraphia in Russian speakers is conceptualized according to the classical approach in Modern Russia. In this review, we describe the classical approach and compare it to the cognitive neuropsychological models of writing disorders that are developed to explain dysgraphia in English and in other Western European languages. We argue that the basic theoretical assumptions of the two approaches - cognitive and classical or syndrome approach - share similarities. It is therefore proposed that identification of acquired cases of dysgraphia in Russian could potentially benefit from taking the cognitive neuropsychological perspective. We also conclude that adopting elements of the syndrome approach would substantially enrich the understanding of acquired dysgraphia since these offer an insight into processes not described in the cognitive neuropsychological approach. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

Relationships between the strategy profiles and the state vector are defined with mappings of rather general forms. Each player makes a decision on her best response to the system's state and the other players' strategies under an additional conjecture about the influence of a variation of her strategy upon the variation of the system's parameters. We consider two versions: (i) constant conjectures, and (ii) a less restrictive variant, when the players' conjectures satisfy certain constraints related to strategy profiles and the system's parameters.

The most common are two definitions: the maximal attractor and the Milnor attractor. The maximal attractor is by definition Lyapunov stable, but it is often in some ways excessive. The definition of Milnor attractor is more realistic from the physical point of view. The Milnor attractor can be Lyapunov unstable though. One of the central problems in the theory of dynamical systems is the question of how typical such a phenomenon is. This article is motivated by this question and contains new examples of so-called relatively unstable Milnor attractors. Recently I. Shilin has proved that these attractors are Lyapunov stable in the case of one-dimensional fiber under some additional assumptions. However, the question of their stability in the case of multidimensional fiber is still an open problem. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2012.",,,,"Maik Nauka-Interperiodica Publishing",,,,,00815438,,,"English","Proc.

They also analyze stages and principles of holding the national testing experiment in regions of Russia and specify the factors of the project success. The experiment was aimed at creating a technology that could be applied in all regions with their specific conditions, a technology that would be trusted by most graduates and applicants, their parents, most universities and schools. Special consideration is given to misuse of the USE results, i.e. using them to create rankings of schools and educational systems in cities and federal subjects, to assess efficiency of governors, or to evaluate teachers). The discussion reveals major advantages and benefits of the USE in comparison to the preceding graduate evaluation system. The speakers point to some errors committed during the project development and implementation and argue why so much time was required to develop and launch the project. The top priority objectives of the USE development include improving examination materials, focusing more on the competency building approach, differentiating examinations in the Russian language and mathematics into basic and advanced levels, and providing information security. The speakers underline the need to investigate the role and place of the USE in evaluating efficiency of teachers and educational institutions. Finally, they discuss the effects of introducing the USE as the key education reform and as a social project of the new Russia.","Advanced examinations; Basic examinations; Competency building approach; Examination materials; Monitoring; Rankings of education systems; Standardized national examinations; Unified state exam",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

The forecasts underestimated threats external to education, which have been dominating over inherent educational policies and developing into insurmountable barriers restricting implementation of efficient strategies. Both seized and missed opportunities are discussed. It turns out that the analyzed period witnessed much less changes than the previous decade and than it had been predicted. The spotlight is thrown on possible mechanisms of changing the educational system: specifics of market laws in education; opportunities provided by proper management; young people's motivation to change the educational system. The speakers point out that resource and time scale of the measures taken is in a huge disproportion with their expected effects. The 2020 Strategy is also viewed from this perspective.

We say that a triplet is stable if it satisfies a somewhat strengthened statement of the simplest SLTR in the sense of part I of this paper [Theory Probab. Appl., 50 (2006), pp. 436-447]. It turns out, in particular, that under wide assumptions SLTR is reduced to testing the stability (sometimes in a weakened form) of various triplets.

Through comparison of the responses from the 2004 and 2010 surveys, changes in the business and management of Russian companies are examined. The perceived abilities to perform particular stages of innovation projects have significantly increased and Russian companies successfully use contractors for various types of innovation activity. However, the intensity of innovations remains low and the resources that can be utilised to create innovations at Russian CEOs' disposal remain limited as few actual innovation projects satisfy the criteria imposed by Russian owners to improve the overall profitability of the firm. The owner's criteria for evaluating innovation effectiveness particularly impede radical product innovations and breakthrough innovations in production technologies. The results of this study indicate that the relationship between the perception of innovative capabilities by CEOs and the intensity of innovations proved to be a valuable research construct and this suggests that comparative study of innovation capabilities of firms in emerging and developed economies would be a profitable extension of this research. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"business development; comparative study; industrial development; industrial enterprise; innovation; Russian Federation",,,,,,,14631377,,PCECF,"English","Post-Communist Econ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859080419

Intellectual capital identification and evaluation is one of the most important issues in knowledge management. Our study focuses on the evaluating intellectual capitalmethods that allow finding out the most efficient way of intellectual capital management, including investment decision making. We suppose that the potential effectiveness of intellectual capital resources varies depending on a company size, industry and country. The majority of the relevant researchesare based on resource- and value-based approaches that separately analyze the intellectual capital from a certain point of view, limiting the number of problems at concurrence of these concepts. Therefore, to solve problems of intellectual capital evaluation we integrate two approaches that are relevant for studying the companies' and industries' behavior. We seek to integrate two approaches to answerfollowing questions: Is there a close relationship between an intellectual capital quality and a company performance: a creation and destruction of the enterprise value due to intellectual capital employed? What are the external and internal factors affecting this relationship? (country, industry, company size, market dynamics, etc.) Is there a certain complementarity of the intellectual capital separate components (human, institutional and market resources)? Despite the large empirical background the intellectual capital management issues fundamentally are not well studied. The purpose of this research is the development of cost-effectiveness tools for analyzing the company's intellectualresources. Several statistical methods should be provided for the empirical issues of this research, includingcommon cross-sectional and panel data analysis. The data base collected for this purpose will consistof financial and economic indicators underlying the intellectual capital evaluation, for example, strategic performance indicators (EVA, FGV, Q-Tobin).It should be emphasized, that a number of required data are quite specific and hardly observed. Thus, the data base of this research founds on the annual statistical and financial reports including the description of some qualitative characteristics of analyzed companies and industries: total labor productivity, staff education level, customer loyalty,product range, R&D expenditures, participation in business associations, co-operative innovation projects, localization and specialization coefficients, and others.

The authors test the unconditional and conditional CAPM specifications on a sample of weekly returns of the most liquid Russian stocks over the financially stable period of 2004–2007 and over the crisis period of 2008–2009. The primary contribution of this study is ranking the models with respect to their explanatory power of cross-sectional return variations. The unconditional classical CAPM (where market risk is approximated by the beta coefficient) is compared to the downside (mean-semivariance) CAPM extended to incorporate the third (skewness) and fourth (kurtosis) moments. The ranking methodology is based on Fama and MacBeth’s (1973) two-stage estimation procedure. The unconditional CAPMs prove to have low explanatory power for the financially stable period and test results that are not statistically significant for the crisis period. Incorporating additional risk measures of the third and fourth moments and adopting one-sided risk measures only slightly increases the explanatory power. The highest explanatory power is offered by the unconditional CAPM of the Harlow-Rao downside systematic risk measure with zero benchmark. Our study confirms the feasibility of employing conditional CAPMs extended for systematic asymmetry (co-skewness) and systematic kurtosis (co-kurtosis) for the Russian stock market since these models display better explanatory power for cross-sectional return variations. © 2011, Eurasia Business and Economics Society.","Cokurtosis; Conditional CAPM; Coskewness; Downside CAPM; Higher Moment CAPM; Russian Stock Market",,,"Springer International Publishing",,,,,1309422X,,,"English","Eurasian Econ.

The Levenberg-Marquardt ANN is widely used for forecasting financial markets, while the Haken ANN is mostly known for the tasks of image recognition. In this paper we apply the Haken ANN for the prediction of the stock market movements. Furthermore, we introduce a novation concerning preprocessing of the input data in order to enhance the predicting power of the abovementioned networks. For this purpose we use Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We also suggest using ANNs to reveal the ""mean reversion"" phenomenon in the stock returns.

The enforcement power of the anti-trust agency has increased dramatically. At the same time adverse trends in competition policy have emerged and strengthened. The main reason was, paradoxically, a growing role of anti-trust policy in the Russian government. The enforcement of anti-trust rules is expected to result immediately in control of the price level and/or support of a defined group of market participants (e.g. suppliers of food products). In this context legal rules are changing in a way that leads to an increase in the number of false positives (type I errors) in anti-trust cases. False positives not only impose a burden on the accused but also distort the incentives of market participants, restrain potentially efficient business practices and also paradoxically can prevent competition. This article considers three examples of adverse development of anti-trust rules in Russia: regulation of trading activity, rules on collusion and excessive prices of collectively dominant market participants, and rules on discrimination as an abuse of a dominant position. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"competition policy; economic policy; incentive; law enforcement; monopoly; price determination; Russian Federation",,,,,,,14631377,,PCECF,"English","Post-Communist Econ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859252334

This chapter provides a review of some of the key challenges for social work in Russia. It focuses on contradictory ideologies that are shaped in discursive formations of social work in education and everyday experience of social workers in post-Soviet Russia. It is based on qualitative methodology, referring to interview material, and discourse analysis of the Russian textbooks used in social work and social policy education. The chapter addresses several main issues: social policy reforms, identity constructions of social workers; managerial modernization of social services and social work ideology; the education policy in particular, discourses of social work teaching materials and the impact of international co-operation in the development of training programs. Social welfare administration in Russia was inherited from Soviet rule with its centrally commanded planning and rigid system of social security based in public institutions. The general modernization of the system of social welfare in Russia is an ongoing process nowadays and it has had a contradictory effect on social work ideology. During 1990s and early 2000s a number of international donors have contributed to the development of higher education in Russia. International effects on social work education in Russia are noticeable at several levels: institutional, systemic, curricular, symbolic and individual. A series of tensions are explored especially in relation to curriculum, standards and modes of regulation; a number of factors are considered that hindered the effectiveness of international exchange programs. The chapter concludes by pointing out the peculiarities of Russian social work and the scenario of its future development. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Such materials are especially attractive for lightweight, flexible, and low-cost solar cells and light emitting devices, as well as transistors and electrophotographic photoreceptors. Yet, even after 40 years of work and a large database, the physics and chemistry that determines the electronic properties of organic materials are not well understood. This paper briefly summarizes data obtained from a new experimental variant of the time of flight (TOF) technique called TOF1a, which are compared to the predictions of a two-layer multiple trapping model (MTM) with an exponential distribution of traps. In TOF1a the charge generation depth is varied continuously, from surface generation to bulk generation, by varying the energy of the electron-beam excitation source. This produces systematic changes in the shape of the current transient that can be compared to the predictions of the two-layer MTM. We find that we can semi-quantitatively fit current transient data over the whole time range of the experiment, but only by using theoretical parameters that lie in a narrow range, the extent of which we quantify here. ©2011 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",,"Charge generation; Current transients; Electron beam excitation; Exponential distributions; Large database; Light emitting devices; Low-cost solar cells; Molecularly doped polymers; Multiple trapping; Organic materials; Surface generations; Systematic changes; Time range; Time-of-flight techniques; Two layers; Forecasting; Power quality; Electronic properties","Society for Imaging Science and Technology (IS and T);Imaging Society of Japan (ISJ);Hewlett-Packard Company;Xerox Corporation",,"27th International Conference on Digital Printing Technologies, NIP27 and 7th International Conference on Digital Fabrication 2011","2 October 2011 through 6 October 2011","Minneapolis, MN",89513,,9780892082964,,"English","Int.

For the data analysis, a representative 4-year panel study of the adult non-immigrant German population collected during the years 2002-2006 is used, and the development of each GFE component is tested by using an unconditional second-order latent growth curve model (LGM) (with full information maximum likelihood, FIML).

However, the sixth aspect, rights of the established, displays a continuous linear increase over time. The different developmental pattern stands in contrast to Allport's (The nature of prejudice. Perseus Books, Cambridge, 1954) hypothesis for the strong link between the components and their development over time.

Moreover, obtaining the oil remaining in currently producing reservoirs requires additional equipment and technology that comes at a higher price in both capital and energy. In this regard, the physical limitations on producing the ever-increasing quantities of oil are highlighted as well as the possibility of the peak of production occurring this decade. The economics of oil supply and demand are also briefly discussed showing why the available supply is basically fixed in the short to medium term. Also, an alarm bell for economic recessions is shown to be when energy takes a disproportionate amount of total consumer expenditures. In this context, risk mitigation practices in government and business are called for. As for the former, early education of the citizenry of the risk of economic contraction is a prudent policy to minimize potential future social discord. As for the latter, all business operations should be examined with the aim of building in resilience and preparing for a scenario in which capital and energy are much more expensive than in the business-as-usual one. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Economic risks; Energy transition risks; Peak oil","Additional equipment; Business operation; Business-as-usual; Consumer expenditure; Deepwater; Economic Recession; Economic risks; Energy transitions; Medium term; Oil supplies; Peak Oil; Physical limitations; Risk mitigation; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Economics; demand analysis; hydrocarbon reservoir; oil supply; risk assessment; twenty first century",,,,,,,03014215,,ENPYA,"English","Energy Policy",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-80855139518

The key outcome is an express estimate of the expected internal wave parameters for different regions of the Baltic Sea. The central kinematic characteristic is the near-bottom velocity in internal waves in areas where the density jump layers are located in the vicinity of seabed. In such areas internal waves are the major driver of sediment resuspension and erosion processes and may be also responsible for destroying the laminated structure of sedimentation regime (that frequently occurs in certain areas of the Baltic Sea).","Density stratification; Gardner equation; Internal soliton; Korteweg-de Vries equation","density; erosion; internal wave; kinematics; lamination; parameterization; resuspension; seafloor; sediment transport; sedimentation; shallow water; wave dispersion; wave field; wave power; wave propagation; wave velocity; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea",,,,,,,07490208,,JCRSE,"English","J.

This conjecture implies the existence of certain structures on the (equivariant) intersection cohomology of the Uhlenbeck partial compactification of the moduli space of framed G-bundles on ℙ. More precisely, it predicts the existence of an action of the corresponding W-algebra on the above cohomology, satisfying certain properties. We propose a ""finite analog"" of the (above corollary of the) AGT conjecture. Namely, we replace the Uhlenbeck space with the space of based quasi-maps from ℙ1 to any partial flag variety G/P of G and conjecture that its equivariant intersection cohomology carries an action of the finite W-algebra U(g,e) associated with the principal nilpotent element in the Lie algebra of the Levi subgroup of P; this action is expected to satisfy some list of natural properties. This conjecture generalizes the main result of [5] when P is the Borel subgroup. We prove our conjecture for G = GL(N), using the works of Brundan and Kleshchev interpreting the algebra U(g,e) in terms of certain shifted Yangians. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,,,,00103616,,,"English","Commun.

In such case, the coefficients at the leading nonlinear terms of the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation vanish simultaneously. It is shown that in such cases there exists a specific balance between the leading nonlinear and dispersive terms. An extension to the mKdV equation is derived by means of combination of a sequence of asymptotic methods. The resulting equation contains a cubic and a quintic nonlinearity of the same magnitude and possesses solitary wave solutions of different polarity. The properties of smaller solutions resemble those for the solutions of the mKdV equation, whereas the height of the taller solutions is limited and they become table-like. It is demonstrated numerically that the collisions of solitary wave solutions to the resulting equation are weakly inelastic: the basic properties of the counterparts experience very limited changes but the interactions are certainly accompanied by a certain level of radiation of small-amplitude waves. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.",,"Asymptotic method; Basic properties; Higher order; Interfacial waves; Korteweg-de Vries equations; MkDv equation; Natural water bodies; Nonlinear terms; Quintic nonlinearity; Solitary wave solution; Three-layer; Control nonlinearities; Solitons; Nonlinear equations",,,,,,,10706631,,PHFLE,"English","Phys.

Their interactions are known as corporate financial architecture according to S. Myers. In this paper we analyze financial architecture which is a mix of ownership structure, capital structure, control and board's composition, and therefore, provides the given framework for improving corporate performance. We contribute to the literature by different attributes of our study. In contrast to most empirical papers on performance, we develop integrated rather than segmented approach combining the intrinsic components of corporate financial design in one research model. We introduce new variable to capture the structure of ownership for the purpose of performance analysis. Our third contribution is based on comparative analysis of the influence of financial architecture over corporate performance in rather different capital market environment: developed European and emerging (developing) capital market's countries. We start with a classic empirical model of the impact of ownership structure, capital structure and other components of financial architecture on the corporate performance. Further we verify the validity of exogenous nature of key variables of the classic model when applying it to companies in developed and emerging market environment. Our results could have some important policy implications for the firms in normal economic environment as well as in the period of global economic crisis. We found that the higher proportion of related ownership which indicates investors with significant voting power and the board's composition affect firm performance positively. The related shareholders and independent directors seem to add more value to firms while the impact of government ownership differs depending on the country. The emerging market's sample versus the one from developed countries proves the stronger influence of corporate financial architecture over performance. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Boards; Corporate governance; Emerging markets; Financial architecture; Ownership structure; Performance",,,,,,,,13853457,,,"English","J.

It extends the standard analysis of tacit collusion by allowing firms to make their strategic choices either simultaneously or sequentially. It is shown that price leadership indeed facilitates collusion by making it easier to punish deviations by the leader. In case of pure Bertrand competition, price leadership restores the scope for (perfect) collusion in markets where collusion would not be sustainable otherwise. When firms face asymmetric costs or offer differentiated products, price leadership can also enhance the profitability of collusion-in case of asymmetric costs, the less efficient firm must act as the leader. Finally, such leadership is less effective in case of Cournot competition since, following an aggressive deviation by the leader, the follower would rather limit its own output, making it more difficult to punish the deviation. Still, quantity leadership may enhance collusion when it is already somewhat effective in a simultaneous move setting. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A grammatical profile is the relative frequency distribution of the inflected forms of a word in a corpus. The grammatical profiles of Russian verbs provide data on two crucial issues: a) the overall relationship between perfective and imperfective verbs and b) the identification of verbs that characterize various intersections of aspect, tense and mood (TAM) with lexical classes. There is a long-standing debate over whether Russian aspectual ""pairs"" are formed only via suffixation (the Isacenko hypothesis) or whether they are formed via both suffixation and prefixation (the traditional view). We test the Isacenko hypothesis using data on the corpus frequency of inflected forms of verbs. We find that the behavior of perfective and imperfective verbs is the same regardless of whether the aspectual relationship is marked by prefixes or suffixes; our finding thus supports the traditional view. Introspective descriptions of Russian aspect have often connected the use of particular inflectional forms with certain uses of aspect; for example, the use of imperative forms with the imperfective aspect to produce expressions that are very polite. Grammatical profiles make it possible to identify verbs that behave as outliers, presenting unusually large proportions of usage in parts of the paradigm. This analysis both gives substance to and extends previous introspective descriptions by identifying the verbs most involved in certain TAM-category interactions. On a methodological level, this study contributes to current discussions on the use of inflected forms vs. lemmas in corpus studies. Newman (2008) finds valuable information at the level of the inflectional form, and Gries (forthcoming) argues that inflectional forms do not necessarily provide a better basis for analysis than lemmas. We agree with them that the appropriate level of granularity is determined by both the language and the linguistic phenomenon under analysis. © 2011 Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co.

The matter of the phenomenon is a sporadic occurrence of unexpectedly high waves on the sea surface. These waves cause serious danger for sailing and sea use. A number of huge wave accidents, resulting in damages, ship losses and people injuries and deaths, are known. Now marine researchers do believe that these waves belong to a specific kind of sea wave, not taken into account by conventional models for sea wind waves. This paper addresses the nature of the rogue wave problem from a general viewpoint based on wave process ideas. We start by introducing some primitive elements of sea wave physics with the purpose of paving the way for further discussion. We discuss linear physical mechanisms which are responsible for high wave formation, at first. Then, we proceed with a description of different sea conditions, starting from the open deep sea, and approaching the sea coast. Nonlinear effects which are able to cause rogue waves are emphasised. In conclusion we briefly discuss the generality of the physical mechanisms suggested for the rogue wave explanation; they are valid for rogue wave phenomena in other media such as solid matters, superconductors, plasmas and nonlinear optics. © 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","freak waves; nonlinear evolution equations; rogue waves; water waves",,,,,,,,00107514,,,"English","Contemp Phys.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856290502

Findings: The paper argues that knowledge transfer between Russian and foreign firms is a two-way road, and the role of ""competence brokers"" is very important. Research limitations/implications: The paper invites scholars to examine knowledge transfer between Russian and Western firms with a more ""stereoscopic view"" by distinguishing various kinds of actors within both Russian and foreign firms.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper contains a discussion of relevant issues and a presentation of research that considers the relationship between organizational design, strategy selection, and the competitive environment within which a firm operates. This research includes an analysis of a survey of top managers and an evaluation of organizational design and firm strategy to determine the existence of strategic misfit. Findings: Misfits in strategy and structure exist because of Russian managerial proclivity to maintain direct control through centralization of all strategic formulations and because of high risk-taking behaviors of Russian managers. While organizational inertia is a clear driver of organizational structure, cultural inertia also exists and, in the case of Russian organizational design, societal organizational culture drives strategy misfits. Practical implications: An understanding of strategic misfits is crucial for managers so that they may recognize these disconnects early and make improvements as market or firm conditions changes. The results of the analysis of Russian firms suggest that in designing efficient organizations, greater attention should be placed on the specific impact of societal organizational culture. In addition, practitioners in organizational design consulting positions should make clear, whenever they attempt to eliminate misfits between existing structures and current strategies, the need to develop effective stretch for implementation of intended strategies. Originality/value: The paper provides a unique application of the connection of strategy and organizational design under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This paper also extends the analysis of organizational design and strategy to firms operating in emerging markets. Rapid changes in dynamic, emerging markets provide fertile testing grounds for management theory and practices; this paper examines a unique set of empirical evidence. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Organizational design; Organizational fit; Recession; Recovery strategies; Russia; Uncertainty management",,,,,,,,19348835,,,"English","Int.

Yet the radius problem-that is, how wide a circle of others respondents imagine as ""most people""-makes comparisons between individuals and countries problematic. Until now, much about the radius problem has been speculation, but data for 51 countries from the latest World Values Survey make it possible to estimate how wide the trust radius actually is. We do this by relating responses to the standard trust question to a new battery of items that measures in-group and out-group trust. In 41 out of 51 countries, ""most people"" in the standard question predominantly connotes out-groups. To this extent, it is a valid measure of general trust in others. Nevertheless, the radius of ""most people"" varies considerably across countries; it is substantially narrower in Confucian countries and wider in wealthy countries. Some country rankings on trust thus change dramatically when the standard question is replaced by a radius-adjusted trust score. In cross-country regressions, the radius of trust matters for civic attitudes and behaviors because the assumed civic nature of trust depends on a wide radius. © American Sociological Association 2011.","civicness; general trust; in-group/out-group trust; social capital; trust radius","social behavior; social capital; socioeconomic survey",,"American Sociological Association",,,,,00031224,,,"English","Am.

The initial ensemble is generated via the polymer-analogous reaction A→B that proceeds with the accelerating effect of neighboring B units. In a two-dimensional model, the reaction is performed in a rectangle composed of stretched chains. Then, the rectangle is closed into a cylinder, so that ring chains are located on its side surface. The self-organization of the ensemble is simulated via the successive rotation of each upper ring over the lower ring until arrangement with the maximum (in modulus) energy of attraction between chains is attained. Self-organization by energy is accompanied by lateral ordering: the sizes of clusters-accumulations of the one-type units-and mean heights H A (H B) of stems-columns consisting of A or B units perpendicular to chains-increase. The ratio between the values of H A, as well as H B, for ordered and initial ensembles is independent of the average composition of the system and as a rule increases as the length of blocks increases and the length of chains decreases. Features of generation of the ensemble of short chains and their ordering are revealed. It is shown that, during ordering of multiblock copolymers, the probabilistic properties (the stochastic behavior) of the ensemble are disturbed. The self-organization of statistical multiblock copolymers in a three-dimensional model is investigated via rotation of rings in the torus of the rectangular cross-section. The effects of various factors on self-organization by energy and local ordering in 2D and 3D models are similar; however, the efficiency of ordering in the three-dimensional system is always lower because, in this case, arrangements with the maximum energy of attraction simultaneously to two neighboring chains, rather than to one, are implemented for the majority of chains. © 2011 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,"3D models; Accelerating effect; Average composition; Bernoulli; Lateral ordering; Local ordering; Multiblock copolymer; Multiblocks; Polymer analogous reaction; Probabilistic properties; Rectangular cross-sections; Self-organizations; Stochastic behavior; Three dimensional systems; Three-dimensional model; Two dimensional model; Copolymerization; Copolymers; Rotation; Three dimensional",,,,,,,0965545X,,,"English","Polym.

Applied examples are given to show how the combination of stochastic and maximin approaches makes it possible to reduce the problems of this type to MCO problems with uncertainty. Both problems are reduced to classical well studied Markowitz model (without uncertainty). Such elimination of uncertainty is possible due to only one criterion depends on uncertainty. Further general case where uncertainty affects the values of all the criteria in an arbitrary manner is considered. For one of possible reasonable concept of P-optimal solution sufficient conditions are presented. They reduce the optimal solution calculation to maximin problem. Constructiveness of the suggested approach is illustrated by an example of multiple criteria linear programming with uncertain coefficients of linear criteria. If these coefficients satisfy given set of linear constraints, the computation of the optimal solutions is reduced to linear programming problem. Finally, some possible directions for future research are discussed. © 2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

In Experiment 1, participants showed the slowest search and the largest number of undetected changes in near condition. Moreover, they misidentified near changes more frequently than central and far ones. In Experiment 2, participants had to search for marginal changes in the presence of a once noticed central change that summoned additional attention to a central location. It resulted in further search slowing for near changes. In Experiment 3, participants searched for one of two concurrent marginal changes in the presence of a central one. They detected far changes about 2.3 times more frequently than near ones. Taken together, these results support the notion of ""dead zone of attention"" surrounding attentional focus.

This review starts with the theoretical definitions of the concepts and differentiates personal, intrapsychic, and motivational autonomy as well as behavioral freedom; delineates the distinction between autonomous and controlled forms of human agency; and relates all these concepts to the notion of human happiness and optimal functioning. It supports the idea of the universality of psychological autonomy as a fundamental capability of human species and argues that this capability is a real natural power that does not contradict the principle of determinism. Special attention is paid to the debates about the role culture plays in enabling and regulating human autonomy.

The main trend in distribution during the recent decades manifests itself in a growing number of network-type distribution chains. Based on the evolutionary trends in distribution research, we came up with the idea to investigate distribution networks processes using mathematical tools of probability theory. We consider a distribution network in a stochastic way, where a focal agent optimizes the distribution chain at each decision-making node by switching between possible partners. This allows us to apply time-homogeneous Markov chains theory to explore the partner selection process. We present an approach that allows for the estimating of implicit non-price variables of partner choice in a supply chain.

We treat a reflection equation algebra as a quantum analog of the algebra of vector fields. The role of a quantum function algebra is played by a general quantum matrix algebra. As an example we mention the so-called RTT algebra of quantized functions on the linear matrix group GL(m). In this case our construction essentially coincides with the quantum differential algebra introduced by S. Woronowicz. If the role of a quantum function algebra is played by another copy of the reflection equation algebra we get two different braided differential algebras. One of them is defined via a quantum analog of (co)adjoint vector fields, the other algebra is defined via a quantum analog of right-invariant vector fields. We show that the former algebra can be identified with a subalgebra of the latter one. Also, we show that ""quantum adjoint vector fields"" can be restricted to the so-called ""braided orbits"" which are counterparts of generic GL(m)-orbits in gl*(m).

The Levenberg-Marquardt ANN is widely used for forecasting financial markets, while the Haken ANN is mostly known for the tasks of image recognition. In this paper we apply the Haken ANN for the prediction of the stock market movements. Furthermore, we introduce a novation concerning pre-processing of the input data in order to enhance the predicting power of the abovementioned networks. For this purpose we use Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We also suggest using ANNs to reveal the ""mean reversion"" phenomenon in the stock returns.

This paper computes the Shaked and Sutton (1982) model for a lognormal distribution of consumer incomes to investigate the effect of inequality on firms' entry, product quality, and pricing decisions. The main findings are that greater inequality in consumer incomes leads to the entry of more firms and results in more intense quality competition among the entrants. More intense quality competition raises the average quality of products in the market as firms compete for the shrinking share of higher-income consumers. With zero costs of quality improvements and an upper bound on the top quality or when costs of quality are fixed and rise sufficiently fast, greater heterogeneity of consumer incomes also reduces firms' incentives to differentiate their products. Competition between more similar products tends to reduce their prices. However, when income inequality is very high, the top quality producer chooses to serve only the rich segment of the market and charges a higher price. The conclusion is that income inequality has important implications for the degree of product differentiation, price level, industry concentration, and consumer welfare. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.","Computational economics; Income inequality; Vertical differentiation","Computational economics; Consumer welfares; Income inequality; Key factors; Log-normal distribution; Market outcomes; Price levels; Pricing decision; Product differentiation; Product quality; Quality competition; Quality improvement; Quality of product; Top qualities; Upper Bound; Vertical differentiation; Willingness to pay; Competition; Costs; Economics; Quality control; Telecommunication industry; Commerce",,,,,,,01677187,,IJIOD,"English","Int J Ind Organiz",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958085562

The 'cultural' interpretation suggests that patriarchal values are an inherent element of Muslim identity. The 'structural' interpretation holds that patriarchal values reside in structural characteristics and have little to do with Muslim identity. Evidence on these contradictory claims is inconclusive. Neither have advocates of the cultural position shown that Muslim support for patriarchal values remains robust under control of structural characteristics; nor have proponents of the structural position demonstrated that Muslim support for these values vanishes under such controls. Filling this gap, we use multi-level models to test whether Muslim support for patriarchal values vanishes under control of patriarchy's structural underpinnings. We find that Muslim support for patriarchal values is robust against various controls; and we identify mosque attendance as a mechanism to sustain Muslim support for patriarchy in non-Muslim societies. Yet, rising levels of education, labor market participation, and a glacial emancipative trend diminish Muslim support for patriarchy, especially among women. © 2011 University of Rome 'La Sapienza'.","Cross-national study; Multiculturalism; Muslim; Patriarchy; Values",,,,,,,,03906701,,,"English","Int.

Using original data from a longitudinal survey covering the period of 1995-2006, this article analyses the impact of transformation in the defence industry on labour and labour-management relations. We find that by the mid-2000s defence enterprises were largely able to stop job losses, eliminate wage arrears and restore wages to the level prevailing in the civilian economy. The study confirms that compared to other sectors of the Russian economy, defence enterprises continue to carry a strong legacy of the Soviet system. The dominant role of state ownership and government orders, along with the relative geographical isolation of defence enterprises and obvious factors of secrecy and security, made labour at these enterprises less willing to challenge management or owners by strikes and open protests. On the other hand, workers of defence enterprises can count on a more paternalistic attitude from managers and relatively more generous welfare benefits. © 2011 University of Glasgow.",,"defense industry; labor market; labor relations; reform process; wage; welfare economics; Russian Federation",,,,,,,09668136,,,"English","Eur.

The wave energy flux at such reflectionless profiles holds, providing the possibility of the energy transfer to high altitudes.

Existing approaches towards resource co-allocation and multiprocessor job scheduling in economic models of distributed computing are based on search of time-slots in resource occupancy schedules. The sought time-slots must match requirements of necessary span, computational resource properties, and cost. Usually such scheduling methods consider only one suited variant of time-slot set. This paper discloses a scheduling scheme that features multi-variant search. Two algorithms of linear complexity for search of alternative variants are compared. Having several optional resource configurations for each job makes an opportunity to perform an optimization of execution of the whole batch of jobs and to increase overall efficiency of scheduling. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Batch; Job; Resource co-allocation; Resource request; Scheduling; Slot; Task","Batch; Co-allocation; Job; Resource request; Slot; Task; Distributed computer systems; Storage allocation (computer); Scheduling algorithms","Elsevier B.V.;University Tsukuba, Center for Computational Sciences",,"11th International Conference on Computational Science, ICCS 2011","1 June 2011 through 3 June 2011","Singapore",85086,18770509,,,"English","Procedia Comput.

The data shows a high, but gradually decreasing ownership stakes of firm insiders (managers and workers). We estimate the effect of a wide range of firm characteristics on the decision to privatize, the initial ownership structure after privatization, and on subsequent changes of ownership stakes. We test and find support for several predictions of the model by Aghion and Blanchard (1998). For example, collusion among workers makes them more reluctant to sell shares to outsiders. Firms in financial distress show a higher incidence of insiders selecting the option of privatization leading to high insider ownership. This can be explained by their desire to insure against unemployment in the case of restructuring by outsiders. No evidence is found of a sequencing in privatization according to the performance of firms before privatization. A methodological novelty of this paper is the application of a tobit model with sample selection to the choice of ownership stakes. © 2010 Association for Comparative Economic Studies.","Insider ownership; Ownership structure; Privatization; Russia; Tobit model with sample selection",,,,,,,,01475967,,,"English","J.

In this case the coordinate transformation significantly changes the form of original quadratic functional. The penalty matrices become dependent on the system state. The linearity of the structure of the transformed system and the quadratic functional make it possible to pass over from the Hamilton-Jacoby-Bellman equation to the Riccati-type equation with state-dependent parameters upon the control synthesis. Note that it is impossible to solve the obtained form of Riccati equation analytically in the general case. It is necessary to approximate the solution; this approximation is realized by numerical methods using symbolic computer packages or interpolation methods. In the latter case, it is possible to obtain the suboptimal control.

Fundamental representations of ε are labeled by a continuous parameter u ∈ ℂ. The representation theory of ε has many properties familiar from the representation theory of glα: vector representations, Fock modules, and semiinfmite constructions of modules. Using tensor products of vector representations, we construct surjective homomorphisms from ε to spherical double affine Hecke algebras SḦN for all N. A key step in this construction is an identification of a natural basis of the tensor products of vector representations with Macdonald polynomials.

Classically, the only way to apply FCA is to binarize the data, thanks to a so-called scaling procedure. This may either involve loss of information, or produce large and dense binary data known as hard to process. In the context of gene expression data analysis, we propose and compare two FCA-based methods for mining numerical data and we show that they are equivalent. The first one relies on a particular scaling, encoding all possible intervals of attribute values, and uses standard FCA techniques. The second one relies on pattern structures without a priori transformation, and is shown to be more computationally efficient and to provide more readable results. Experiments with real-world gene expression data are discussed and give a practical basis for the comparison and evaluation of the methods. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.","Conceptual scaling; Formal concept analysis; Gene expression data; Numerical data; Pattern structures","Conceptual scaling; Formal Concept Analysis; Gene expression data; Numerical data; Pattern structures; Information analysis; Numerical methods; Textile printing; Gene expression",,,,,,,00200255,,ISIJB,"English","Inf Sci",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952191194

We use a pseudo-Boolean representation of PMP instances that allows several reduction techniques to be applied in a straightforward way: combining similar monomials in the polynomial, truncation of the polynomial from degree (m-1) to (m-p) implying costs matrix truncation and exclusion of some rows from the costs matrix (preprocessing based only on compactification of the costs matrix), decomposition of the polynomial into the minimum number of expressions inducing the minimum number of aggregated columns (reduction of the columns' number in the costs matrix). We show that the reduced instance has at most Σi=1m-pmin{n,mi}+1 nonzero entries. We also provide results of computational experiments with the mentioned reductions that allow classification of the benchmark data complexity. Finally, we propose a new benchmark library of instances not amenable to size reduction by means of data compactification. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Data complexity; P-Median problem; Problem size reduction; Pseudo-Boolean polynomial","Benchmark data; Compactification; Computational experiment; Data complexity; Experimental evaluation; matrix; Nonzero entries; P-Median problem; P-median problems; Problem size; Pseudo-Boolean polynomial; Pseudo-Boolean representations; Reduction techniques; Size reductions; Solution algorithms; Costs; Data reduction; Polynomials; Size determination; Matrix algebra",,,,,,,08957177,,MCMOE,"English","Math.

We establish existence and uniqueness results for the conjectural variations equilibrium (called an exterior equilibrium) for any set of feasible conjectures. To introduce the notion of an interior equilibrium, we develop a consistency criterion for the conjectures (referred to as influence coefficients) and prove the existence theorem for the interior equilibrium (understood as a CVE with consistent conjectures). To prepare the base for the extension of our results to the case of non-differentiable demand functions, we also investigate the behavior of the consistent conjectures in dependence upon a parameter representing the demand function's derivative with respect to the market price. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The self-excitation captures the microscopic origin of the emergent endogenous self-organization properties, such as the energy cascade in turbulent flows, the triggering of aftershocks by previous earthquakes and the ""reflexive"" interactions of financial markets. The SEMF process has all the standard stylized facts found in financial time series, which are robust to the specification of the parameters and the shape of the memory kernel: multifractality, heavy tails of the distribution of increments with intermediate asymptotics, zero correlation of the signed increments and long-range correlation of the squared increments, the asymmetry (called ""leverage"" effect) of the correlation between increments and absolute value of the increments and statistical asymmetry under time reversal. © 2011 Europhysics Letters Association.",,,,,,,,,02955075,,,"English","EPL",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957517341

Recently a test of the CDM was proposed: it was predicted that the dipolar disorder energy can be obtained from the slope of the log of the mobility versus square root of the electric field (the Poole-Frenkel or PF slope). We find that the dipolar disorder energy obtained from the experimental PF slopes are almost always larger than the theoretical predictions, especially for MDPs made from dopants with low dipole moments. In addition, the theory relates the dipolar disorder energy to the temperature T0 at which the electric field dependence of the mobility vanishes. We find that the observed T0 does appear to increase as the dipolar disorder increases but is in quantitative agreement (within 25 K) with the theoretical predictions for only a limited set of the measurements. We conclude that it appears that the CDM needs further development to be consistent with charge transport in organic materials. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Charge transport; Correlated disorder model; Dipolar disorder; Electric field dependence; Further development; Molecularly doped polymers; Organic materials; Poole-Frenkel; Quantitative agreement; Square roots; Theoretical prediction; Doping (additives); Electric fields; Forecasting; Polymers",,,,,,,19327447,,,"English","J.

By contrast, the empirical claim about most Asians' dismissal of emancipative values and liberal democracy has not been tested on a broadly cross-cultural basis. Filling this gap, this article uses data from the World Values Surveys to put the values of Asian populations into global perspective. As a result, the differences between Asian and Western populations over emancipative values and liberal democracy appear to be gradual, not categorical. What is more, the forces of modernization that gave rise to emancipative values and a liberal notion of democracy in the 'West', are doing the same in the 'East', confirming a universal model of human development rather than Asian exceptionalism, or any other form of cultural exceptionalism. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2011.",,,,,,,,,14681099,,,"English","Jpn.

The aim of this work was to design didactic objects that will stimulate preschoolers' experimental thinking and to study young children's thinking in relation to these objects. Six heuristic rules for the design of didactic objects are specified, and the responses of 623 children aged between 3 and 7 to the didactic objects are described in this paper. The first two calculating devices required rods to be pressed simultaneously for successive windows to be lit up or made visible. A total of 30 five year olds played with these for 20 minutes, and were seen to perform a logical series of actions in order to understand the device's function. Half of the children counted the presses and thereby understood the way the device functioned. The second device was designed to allow all possible combinations of four variables. Sixty children between the ages of 4 and 6 played with the device for 20 minutes. A total of 88% of the children found all possible combinations of the device, with no differences between age groups in the strategies used. The third device had a matrix of shutters opened by buttons arrayed along two edges. In the first mode, single buttons presses opened the nearest windows and button presses along both edges opened windows on coordinates determined by the two buttons. In the second mode, single button presses opened nothing and simultaneous button presses along two edges opened windows on coordinates determined by the two buttons. Ninety children between the ages of 5 and 10 played with the device in the second mode for 20 minutes. The children used scientific strategies to discover the device's function in the following proportions: 20% at five years, 50% at six years and 93% at 10 years. Eighteen children between the ages of 4 and 6 played with the device in the second mode. They played in pairs, and each child was assigned a row of buttons, thus requiring co-operation to open the windows requiring two coordinated button presses. All the children were eventually successful in the joint experimentation. The fourth device had 16 windows and eight buttons, which lit up the windows when pressed in logical combinations. A total of 20 five-yearold children were trained on this device to use combinations of button presses to light up selected windows. These children were then allowed to explore the third device in second mode by themselves. The trained five year olds all used scientific strategies in their search for the third device's combinations. The study showed that preschoolers can combine actions and discover hidden relationships, and that the didactic objects can be used to develop children's thinking. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Causal-experimental thought; Combinatorial experimentation; Preschool children; Teaching; Zone of proximal development",,,,,,,,09669760,,,"English","Int.

For instance, it may be expected that a restrictive MPAA rating is a box office poison for a family comedy, whereas it insignificantly influences an action movie's revenues. Using a finite mixture model we extract two latent groups, the differences between that can be explained in part by the movie genre, the source, the creative type and the production method. On the basis of this result, the authors recommend developing separate movie success models for different segments, rather than adopting an approach, that was commonly used in previous research, when one explanatory or predictive model is developed for the whole sample of movies. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","box office; finite mixture model; latent class; movie success; quantile regression",,,,,,,,09673237,,,"English","J.

These resources are then used by the party candidates to enhance the electoral perception of their quality or valence. We construct an empirical model of the United States presidential election of 2008 and employ the electoral perception of the character traits of the two candidates. We use a simulation technique to determine the local Nash equilibrium, under vote share maximization, of this model. The result shows that the unique vote-maximizing equilibrium is one where the two candidates adopt convergent positions, close to the electoral center. This result conflicts with the estimated positions of the candidates in opposed quadrants of the policy space. The difference between estimated positions and equilibrium positions allows us to estimate the influence of activist groups on the candidates. We compare this estimation with that of Israel for the election of 1996, and show that vote maximization leads low valence parties to position themselves far from the electoral origin. We argue that these low valence parties in Israel will be dependent on support of radical activist groups, resulting in a degree of political fragmentation. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,,,,01761714,,,"English","Soc.

There is no empirical support for this prediction. In order to account for the phenomenon of political divergence, this paper offers a stochastic electoral model where party leaders or candidates are differentiated by differing valences-the electoral perception of the quality of the party leader. If valence is simply intrinsic, then it can be shown that there is a ""convergence coefficient"", defined in terms of the empirical parameters, that must be bounded above by the dimension of the space, in order for the electoral mean to be a Nash equilibrium. This model is applied to elections in Turkey in 1999 and 2002. The idea of valence is then extended to include the possibility that activist groups contribute resources to their favored parties in response to policy concessions from the parties. The equilibrium result is that parties, in order to maximize vote share, must balance a centripetal electoral force against a centrifugal activist effect. We estimate pure spatial models and models with sociodemographic valences, and use simulations to compare the equilibrium predictions with the estimated party positions. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,,,,01761714,,,"English","Soc.

The main finding is that recurrent outbursts of extreme inflation in these economies can be explained by a certain hysteresis effect associated with public finance. This interpretation meets the evidence that dramatic shifts between regimes of moderately high and extremely high (hyper-) inflation often occur without visible deterioration in public finance or abrupt shifts in fiscal or monetary policies. The existence of this hysteresis effect is explicitly explained by the action of two mechanisms: the arithmetic associated with the wrong side of the inflation tax Laffer curve and the Patinkin effect (the reverse of the much oftener cited Olivera-Tanzi effect). It is also shown that the division of the operational budget deficit into the part that is subject to negative inflation feedback and the part that is inflation-proof has implications for both the discussion of the inflationary consequences of budget deficits and the design of stabilization policy. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Budget deficit; High inflation; The Patinkin effect","budget deficit; financial market; financial system; fiscal policy; inflation; monetary policy; public spending",,,,,,,0954349X,,,"English","Struct.

The two versions of the technique with the bulk and surface generation of charge carriers under small-signal conditions are employed. Numerical calculations show that the time dependence of the transient-current curves obtained with the first version of the technique is in agreement with the theory of multiple trapping for an exponential energy distribution of traps. In the case of time-of-flight curves with surface generation, the run of the post-transit branch is likewise consistent with the theory, whereas this consistency is often violated for the pretransit branch of the curves. This result is due to the effect of the defective surface layer of a polymer, which is not taken into account in numerical calculations. The results show that the hole transport in the studied molecularly doped polymers is dispersive.

Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) and single photon Transit Time Spread (TTS) are considered to be the key characteristics for time resolution responsible photodetectors within such applications. The measurements of PDE and TTS are rather independent and require different techniques and setups. We consider the probability of single photon detection as a defective cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the single photon transit time, so a number of analytical expressions of how it can be reconstructed from the multi-photon TTS histogram affected by the dark counts have been found. It has allowed us to suggest a robust quantitative method of a single photon detection characterization provided with both single photon TTS and PDE.

Convincing numerical experiments have been obtained by these authors, but no error estimates have been proven so far. In the present paper we study the special case of Nikishin systems and their Hermite-Padé approximants, both theoretically and numerically. We obtain rates of convergence by using orthogonality properties of the functions involved along with results from logarithmic potential theory. In particular, we address the question of how to choose the degrees of the approximants, by considering diagonal and row sequences, as well as linear Hermite-Padé approximants. Our theoretical findings and numerical experiments confirm that these Hermite-Padé approximants are more efficient than the more elementary Pad́e approximants, particularly around the discontinuity of the goal function f. © 2010 American Mathematical Society.",,,,,,,,,00255718,,,"English","Math.

This condition can be checked experimentally and incorporates only as a particular case the assumption on perfect correlations or anticorrelations usually argued for this inequality in the literature. Specifying this general condition for a quantum bipartite case, we introduce the whole class of bipartite quantum states, separable and nonseparable, that (i) admit an LHV description under any bipartite measurements with two settings per site; (ii) do not necessarily exhibit perfect correlations and may even have a negative correlation function if the same quantum observable is measured at both sites, but (iii) satisfy the 'perfect correlation' version of the original Bell inequality for any three bounded quantum observables A1, A2 = B1, B 2 at sites 'A' and 'B', respectively. Analysing the validity of this general LHV condition under classical and quantum correlation scenarios with the same physical context, we stress that, unlike the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, the original Bell inequality distinguishes between classicality and quantum separability. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,,17518113,,,"English","J.

This area is targeted by numerous studies primarily aimed at its qualitative characteristics. Basing on data obtained from an annual monitoring survey of the KIS sector, performed by the HSE ISSEK since 2006, the author reveals the innovative capacity of the KIS and assesses the prospects for its further development. The study shows that the evolution of the KIS sector is dominated by the two vectors, aimed respectively at standardizing and customizing services. The latter is especially gaining momentum. In this respect, distinction is a key competitive advantage for a service provider. Alongside with evolving innovation and diversified production, this trend will only increase. It is noteworthy that the recent financial and economic crisis has significantly spurred the service firms' innovation activity. A distinctive feature of the KIS sector is the ability to shape consumers' aptitude to innovation by the means of ""smart"" services. Accounting for a growing demand for product, organizational, governance and marketing innovations aimed at dealing with the specific customer, the agenda towards customization will be also accepted by other sectors. This makes a significant contribution to evolving economics of knowledge. Such a context requires changing manufacturers' patterns of thought. In this sense KIS serve as an effective tool to foster innovative behavior. In parallel with the widening customers' propensity to innovate the range of services and demand for them are also growing thus motivating manufacturers to develop more advanced services. This process thus is self-reinforcing.","Co-production of services; Customization; Innovation activity; Innovation performance; Knowledge-intensive business services; Service industrialization; Service innovation; Standard services",,,"National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics",,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886543101

It presents major basic business models and investment strategies, assesses the contribution of venture capital (VC) to economic growth as well as incentives and constraints for VC's development, and identifies research gaps in this area. Venture capital is often regarded as the only source for supporting start-ups, particularly that ones in high-tech innovative sectors. The authors disclose the prerequisites for this situation. It is emphasized that in contrast to most traditional investors a VC provider must possess sound skills in the target area of investment as well as long-term strategic focus. The financial capital venture capitalists provide however is only one of the benefits they bring to entrepreneurs. Venture capitalists support companies with industry knowledge and social capital which has often proved vital for their success. Also, venture capital acts in an intermediate role for companies to attract further financial means. These circumstances made public administrators interested in venture capital, and more and more nations adapt pro-investment policies to support their ailing economies and to assure future competitiveness. The authors believe that governments can only do so much to spur creative thinking and entrepreneurial activities. The best chance to be attractive for international investors is probably a pro-active stance towards education, combined with the creation of a culture which rewards competitive and entrepreneurial thinking. These processes take a long time to manifest, but they are vital. In conclusion, the authors point to the need to introduce new and refined research strategies in VC area. One key focus to study venture capital is to understand how the industry itself is developing through its own drive. It would help to see at what stage of development the venture capital industry of a country is in comparison to others.

Thus, psychedelic phenomena can be heuristic tools and intriguing objects of the scientific study. I consider two types of psychedelic phenomena in particular. The first is the moral cleansing that may accompany a psychedelic trip. The second is the appearance of visual and auditory hallucinations. I establish a unified explanatory ground for the phenomena that are commonly viewed as distinct in their genesis. I explain both types of phenomena as products of the amplified imaginative ability of the brain under a substance's influence. I suggest that the activation of imagination causes an increased empathy and thus accentuates moral feelings. I propose the hypothesis that hallucinations are mental objects of a quantum nature.

One of the most important behaviors in the domain of CSP is volunteerism. This study examined the reciprocal causal relationship between volunteerism and life satisfaction. Based on the findings and limitations of previous research, this study had four objectives: to examine the relationship between life satisfaction and volunteerism in a multivariate context with a large number of controls that have been previously shown to relate to both variables as antecedents; to examine these relationships in a large, national sample comprised of people from a variety of different age groups; to examine whether the relationship between life satisfaction and volunteerism was moderated by self-esteem; and finally, to address some of the methodological limitations of previous studies by investigating the relationships between the two variables in a longitudinal context with four waves of data collection. Several theoretical mechanisms served as the foundation for the hypothesized relationships between the variables in the study. The results of this study indicated that there is indeed a reciprocal causal relationship between life satisfaction and volunteerism, though the link from life satisfaction to volunteerism has received more support in the general sample than from volunteerism to life satisfaction. In addition, self- esteem was also shown to moderate the relationship between life satisfaction and volunteerism. These results have implications for both theory and practice.","Life satisfaction; Self-esteem; Volunteerism","Age groups; Causal relationships; Data collection; Firm Performance; Life satisfaction; Longitudinal analysis; Self-esteem; Social performance; Theory and practice; Volunteerism","China Europe International Business School;et al.;European School of Management and Technology (ESMT);Rutgers University, School of Management and Labor Relations;Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM);University of South Alabama, Mitchell College of Business","Academy of Management","71st Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management - West Meets East: Enlightening, Balancing, Transcending, AOM 2011","12 August 2011 through 16 August 2011","San Antonio, TX",88981,,,,"English","Acad.

This makes issues of urban perspectives utterly relevant. In recent years, this area is covered by numerous studies, most of the world's renowned urbanists and experts in the areas, one way or another connected with the development of the urban environment, share the viewpoint on radically changing global context that leads to a paradigm shift with regard to urban development. Since the evolution adhered to the conventional imperative ""growth a tout prix"" can no longer ensure the harmonious development and high-quality habitat, so a new philosophy of urban development emerges. An urgent task is to gain a new image of a healthy and creative city. The paper considers the essence of the processes that put in the pledge of the changing paradigm, explores new approaches, concepts and policy instruments that are essential for the transition to a higher level of urban environment quality. It is generally acknowledged that lateral thinking presuming an explicit division of an urban territory into functional areas is no longer up to date and it is necessary to take up creative, synthesis and multidisciplinary approaches. In the framework of the latter a city is regarded as a holistic organism, whereas challenges are interpreted as a source of new opportunities. In order to meet the consistency criteria, a city should function as a single system that is being one large project, aptly integrated by participative creativity and innovative spirit. Achieving such an objective cannot have a general solution; it all depends on the specifics of a particular city. The authors give examples of successfully implemented urban strategies that can be a role model for cities that have embarked on choosing a new direction of development. The realization of such innovative strategies requires a critical mass of like-minded innovators who can lead the process of urban transformation. This becomes possible by the formation of human capital, capable of developing new flexible strategies on an interdisciplinary basis, identifying implicit sources of potential growth and using the advanced policy instruments simultaneously at the conceptual, disciplinary and promotional levels. This requires the restructuring of the governance system and training city managers by earmarked programmes, partnering with research universities, the creation of R&D departments within municipal governing bodies, and an active involvement of citizens in decision-making process regarding to the city development, etc. The availability or lack of these factors predetermines scenarios of urban development - whether would it be a gradual decline or the formation of a ""vibrant"" environment with a higher quality of life.","Creative city; Eco-city; Global city; Megapolis; Paradigm shift; Smart city; Strategy of urban development; Urban population; Urbanization",,,"National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics",,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886569078

Graphical analysis on the basis of three parameters, namely, GRP, number of employed in the economy, and labor productivity, made it possible to decompose the branch shift of regional economies into the following components: DIF effect (contribution of a branch's internal efficiency), MIX effect (effect of the structure of the regional economy), and the effect of national development factors.

In particular, they are needed to determine the cost of capital. Market equilibrium models posit that expected returns are proportional to the sensitivities to systematic risk factors. Fama and French (1993) three-factor model explains the stock returns premium as a sum of three components due to different risk factors: the traditional CAPM market beta, and the betas to the returns on two portfolios, Small Minus Big (the differential in the returns on stocks of small and big companies) and High Minus Low (the differential in returns on the of companies with high and low price-to-book ratio). The authors argue that this model is sufficient to capture the impact on returns of companies' accounting fundamentals,such as earnings-to-price, cash flow-to-price, past sales growth, long term and short-term past earnings. Using a panel of stock returns and accounting data from 1979 to the end of 2008 for the companies listed on NYSE, we show that this is not the case, at least at individual stocks' level. According to our findings, fundamental characteristics of companies' performance are of higher importance to predict future expected returns than sensitivities to the risk factors. We explain this finding within the rational pricing paradigm: contemporaneous accounting fundamentals may be better proxies for future sensitivity to risk factors, than sensitivities, estimated from historical data. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

A bicluster reflects a strong association between a subset of objects and a subset of attributes in a numerical object/attribute data-table. So called biclusters of similar values can be thought as maximal sub-tables with close values. Only few methods address a complete, correct and non redundant enumeration of such patterns, which is a well-known intractable problem, while no formal framework exists. In this paper, we introduce important links between biclustering and formal concept analysis. More specifically, we originally show that Triadic Concept Analysis (TCA), provides a nice mathematical framework for biclustering. Interestingly, existing algorithms of TCA, that usually apply on binary data, can be used (directly or with slight modifications) after a preprocessing step for extracting maximal biclusters of similar values.","Numerical biclustering; Scaling; Triadic concept analysis","Data mining; Gene expression; Information analysis; Bi-clustering; Data mining tasks; Formal framework; Gene Expression Data; Mathematical frameworks; Pre-processing step; Scaling; Triadic concept analysis; Formal concept analysis","CNRS GDR I3;Institut National Polytechnique de Lorraine (INPL)","CEUR-WS","8th International Conference on Concept Lattices and Applications, CLA 2011","17 October 2011 through 20 October 2011",,110667,16130073,9782905267788,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924202145

We then consider a superextension of the theory which eliminates the divergences and makes the theory naively invariant.

We then investigate the behavior of this extended theory under diffeomorphisms of the extended phase space and despite of its naive invariance find out that the theory possesses anomaly under nonlinear diffeomorphisms.

Especially, these issues are noticeable if the outdated system worked for a long period of time; it stores a great amount of data, which need to be transferred to the new system. Sometimes the data formats are fully incompatible. In most cases data migration is possible; however there is no way to move data from old to new system completely. This paper describes the intermediate period, when the new system is being implemented and the old system is being retired. Two approaches of organizing the system replacement process are suggested on condition that the old data will be entirely saved to new system: parallel exploitation of outdated and new systems and preliminary data conversion. The classification of data conversion processes is provided in this work. The conversion organization process is analyzed from two perspectives - labour coefficients and possibilities of automation. The following types of conversion are described: automatic and half-automatic. Based on the given classification, the practical experience of data conversion in the information system renewal process is revealed. The basic software tools for automated data conversion are described. One of the developed tools for this task is a special data conversion framework written in C# for the Microsoft .NET platform. This framework implements ETL principles (extract, transform and load) and allows developers to quickly build application for data conversion. The classified data is the address set describing the political division?s objects in Russian Federation?s subjects. The classification process is consists in determining the address code from the standard classifier based on the textual address description. This approach allows developers to reduce time costs required for conversion of large data mass. After the description of automatic data conversion products developed for address classification, the advantages of their usage in system renewal process are pointed out at the end of paper. © 2010 IEEE.","data conversion; Deployment; ETL process; object classification problem; process classification system","Data conversion; Deployment; ETL process; Object classification; Process classification; Classification (of information); Metadata; Software engineering; Data handling",,,"2010 6th Central and Eastern European Software Engineering Conference, CEE-SECR 2010","13 October 2010 through 15 October 2010","Moscow",85262,,9781457706066,,"Russian","Cent.

Numerous scenarios of emissions growth presume that it cannot grow infinitely: there are certain limits that may not or must not be exceeded. The purpose of my work is to develop a model for analyzing the limits to CO 2 emissions growth and to consider how they may change in the future. Applying the theory of pulsing logistic growth, I assume that CO 2 emissions grow in agreement with the logistic equation where carrying capacity, K (or limit to growth) is a function of time, K(t). In the classic theory of pulsing logistic growth K (t) is supposed to be a stepwise function. In contrast, I suppose that it should be a continuous function and derive it from observations. In order to find changing limits to growth (that is, K(t)), I solve inverse Cauchy problem. Results allow us to detect two pulses of logistic growth. The first pulse culminated in 1930s. The second pulse recently entered the culmination phase. Unexpected acceleration of emissions growth observed in 2000-2004 may indicate to the start of the third pulse, which carrying capacity is even higher. Obviously, constructing a scenario of emissions growth one should pay attention to the fact that limits to their growth does not remain constant. They were and would be changing because of technological advances. Software, developed in course of this study, open wide opportunity for using the theory of pulsing growth in evaluating scenarios of CO 2 emissions growth.",,"Cauchy problems; Continuous functions; Function of time; Logistic equations; Logistic growth; Technological advances; Inverse problems; Sustainable development; Teaching; Carbon dioxide","Beijing Development Area Co., Ltd.;Computing Research Laboratory for the Environment (CRLE);Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.

It is shown that proto-fuzzy concepts are closely related to crisply generated fuzzy concepts in the sense that the mappings involved in the definitions coincide for crisp subsets of attributes. Moreover, a proto-fuzzy concept determines a crisp subset of attributes, which generates a (crisply generated) fuzzy concept. However, the reverse is true only in part: given a crisp subset of attributes, one can find a proto-fuzzy concept whose intent includes (but not necessarily coincides with) the given subset of attributes. Interval pattern concepts are shown to be related to crisply generated formal concepts. In particular, every crisply closed subset of objects is an extent of an interval pattern concept.",,"Closed subsets; Crisply generated fuzzy concepts; Formal concepts; Fuzzy concept; Interval pattern concepts; Pattern structure; Proto-fuzzy concepts; Information analysis; Textile printing; Set theory",,,"7th International Conference on Concept Lattices and Their Applications, CLA 2010","19 October 2010 through 21 October 2010","Sevilla",101336,16130073,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960303054

To attain the goal, I propose modelling in two steps. At step one, we have to single out a unified parameter that sets time scale of perception. Changing substantially the value of the parameter would mean changing scale. I argue that the required parameter is duration of discrete perceptive frames, or snapshots, whose sequencing constitutes perceptive process. I show that different standard durations of perceptive frames is the ground for differences in perceptive time scales of various animals. Abnormally changed duration of perceptive frames is the cause of the effect of distorted subjective time observed by humans under some conditions. Now comes step two of the modelling. By inserting some arbitrary duration of a perceptive frame, we set a hypothetical scale and thus emulate a viewpoint for virtual observation of the reality in a wider or narrower angle of embracing events in time. Like changing lenses of a microscope, viewing reality in different temporal scales makes certain features of reality manifested, others veiled. These are, in particular, features of life. If we observe an object in an inappropriate interval, we may not notice the very essence of a process it is undergoing. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bergson; Biological species; Cosmology; Event; High-speed and time-lapse cinematography; Levels; Mental experiment; Perception of time; Psilocybin; Psychedelics; Quantum; Subjective time; Time scales; Virtual observation",,,,,,,,11221151,,,"English","Axiomathes",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-78249251498

Countries' educational systems display attempts to incorporate cross-cultural studies in their curricula across all stages of formal learning. Many higher education institutions offer special courses aimed at promoting cross-cultural studies. One of the tools used to facilitate the process is e-learning. The present article examines the case study of an internetbased collaboration between two higher education institutions - State University Higher School of Economics in Russia and Champlain College in the USA - in fostering crosscultural understanding. The project is based on the study of individualistic and collectivistic values within the framework of two corresponding courses studied at both institutions. The topicality of the study is determined by the growing importance of the cooperation of two countries on the international affairs arena, on the one hand, and the fundamental differences of the countries' underlying value system, on the other. In particular, a post-soviet Russia is generally viewed as a developing democracy representing the collectivistic end of the value spectrum, whereas the USA is considered as an extreme case of individualistic value system. The comparison and contrast of the two systems conducted simultaneously by the representatives of both cultures (students of the two universities) within a specifically built internet forum comprises the base of the project. The case study covers the project's objectives, its background, the rationale behind its content choice, the design of the elearning tool, the profile of the participants of the project, its implementation stages and its outcome. The major findings of the case study deal with the process of building cross-cultural awareness, reinforcing students' analytical skills and providing them with a research incentive, fostering self-reflection, values projection from one culture onto the other, drawing the areas of their intersection, which, finally, result in cross-cultural understanding. The results of the study are assessed at quantative and qualitative levels.","Cross-cultural understanding; Education; Elearning; International collaboration","Analytical skills; Cross-cultural study; Cross-cultural understanding; E-learning tool; Educational systems; Formal learning; Higher education institutions; Higher School; International affairs; International collaborations; Internet-based collaboration; Self reflection; Value systems; E-learning; Education; International cooperation; Public policy; Social sciences; Students; Research",,,,,,,18688799,,,"English","Int.

The developers of task and bug tracking systems now offer their solutions by a monthly fee. For instance, JIRA Studio produced by Atlassian can be connected to a corporative domain by subscription. This scheme allows software companies to reduce costs at the project's start and get scalable resources in future. Software documentation systems can also be purchased by a subscription now. The effectiveness of their usage for various documentation development is interesting. There are four major types of documentation supporting the development process and resulted products: project, technical, code and user documentation. Each of this type claims specific requirements for the documentation tool. The requirement analysis shows that rented documentation systems are the most appropriate for user and technical documentation. There are two major classes of software documentation systems: • Wiki, • DITA-oriented XML CMS. The following wiki systems have a hosted version: commercial - Confluence, Central Desktop, EditMe, Incentive, Netcipia, PBWiki, Wikia, Wikispaces; open source - BusinessWiki, Metadot Wiki, MindTouch, Wagn, Wikidot. The richest by the functionality and plugin collection is Confluence produced by Atlassian. The following XML CMS are offered by a SaaS model (all are commercial): Astoria On Demand, DITA Exchange. DocZone. SaaS is optionally supported in Bluestream XDocs, Siberlogic SiberSafe, Trisoft Infoshare, Vasont, X-Hive Docato. As wiki system is a ready integrated environment for creating and publishing documentation, DITA-system consists not only of XML CMS. To deploy a DITA-system, you should have an XML editor, publisher and CMS. The listed CMS can be integrated with top DITA XML editors and provide an API to integrate with other editors. These CMS also have build-in tools to export documents in multiple formats. However, the universal component architecture of DITA-systems makes the deployment and configuration more difficult than wiki implementation. Hosted documentation systems are offered by different prices. The offerings of top documentation systems are considered in this paper. Wiki subscription fees range from 4,95$ (EditMe) to 20$ (Confluence) per one user/month. XML CMS subscription price starts from 500$ per month and can reach 12000$ per month. These subscriptions have no fixed price; in each individual case the CMS vendor performs a specific project of a DITA-system implementation. Wiki rental costs approximate to CMS subscriptions' costs for large number of users, 500 and more.The advantages of renting a powerful documentation system for small and large project are the following: • Maximal functionality at a low affordable cost, • Platform independency and high system accessibility, • Document quality improvement at the expense of quality controlling tools application, • Higher effectiveness of documentation (content re-use, single source usage, automated tools for localization), • Organization of robust and scalable documentation process. As the SaaS business model becomes more popular, small companies get access to powerful software documentation systems, which are too expensive to purchase a standalone license at the startup. However, the system's access security, reliability and information confidentiality issues remain opened and controversial. © 2010 IEEE.","SaaS; Software documentation; wiki; XML CMS","Automated tools; Bug tracking system; Component architectures; Content re-use; Deployment and configuration; Development process; Document quality; Documentation systems; Documentation tools; Fixed prices; Information confidentiality; Integrated environment; Large project; Open sources; Plug-ins; Requirement analysis; SaaS; SaaS business model; Single source; Small companies; Software company; Software documentation; Software-as-a-Service; Technical documentations; wiki; XML-editors; Economic analysis; Quality control; Software engineering; XML; Costs",,,"2010 6th Central and Eastern European Software Engineering Conference, CEE-SECR 2010","13 October 2010 through 15 October 2010","Moscow",85262,,9781457706066,,"Russian","Cent.

Its history in the preceding 50 years is presented as a successive change of three models-latent growth, import-dependent and rooted-each regarded in four dimensions: developmental driving forces, sector structure, dominant organizational culture and relations with the state. The character and change of models are explained proceeding from the demand/ supply characteristics of resources and institutions of the sector. Major attention belongs to the rooted model, which is presently taking shape. This versatile and problem-laden process is analysed on the basis of civil society monitoring conducted with the authors' participation since 2006. This analysis reveals rather intensive import substitution of the resources and institutions of the sector and the emergence of prerequisites for its sustainable development. Their implementation depends, however, on the state of the economic, social and cultural environment and requires elimination of some political obstacles. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Demand for and supply of institutions; Foreign donors; Import substitution; Model of civil society; Russia",,,,,,,,17448689,,,"English","J.

In difference to homogeneous systems, heterogeneous data source systems can be described by various data models. Integration of heterogeneous data source means creation of the general scheme of the description of the given all subsystems for the unified access to the data, with preservation of semantics of this data. Our article is attempt of consideration of the various models used to describe the general scheme of databases. Ideas of conceptual modeling are not a new phenomenon in the modern world. Sources of researches in the given direction have arisen in 70-s' years 20 centuries and were connected with software development. Concepts were used to describe the data abstractions with respect to idea of encapsulation data from users. In our work we analyze few most popular approaches which can used to represent heterogeneous data. Our special attention was given to ER model, ORM model, RM/T model, functional approach, semantic networks and ontology. We identified benefits and weaknesses of these models. We propose few statements which ""ideal"" model must be satisfied. We argue that existing models are not satisfied to all of these principles. It is necessary to develop new models which would be a composition of existing approaches. This approach must be founded on few statements: based on types of object; able to tracking dynamic of the universe of discus; software implementation independence; knowledge models compatible; semantic interoperability; user-friendly notation; integrity, consistency, redundancy data verification mechanisms; reused components, support different data viewpoint. © 2010 IEEE.","conceptual models; data models; heterogeneous data","Conceptual model; Conceptual modeling; Data abstraction; Data verification; ER-models; Functional approach; Heterogeneous data; Heterogeneous data sources; Heterogeneous sources; Homogeneous system; Knowledge model; New model; Semantic interoperability; Semantic network; Software implementation; Information technology; Models; Ontology; Semantics; Software design; Data handling",,,"2010 6th Central and Eastern European Software Engineering Conference, CEE-SECR 2010","13 October 2010 through 15 October 2010","Moscow",85262,,9781457706066,,"Russian","Cent.

The purpose of this paper was to test empirically whether selective migration with respect to entrepreneurial characteristics may explain this difference. The relevant hypotheses were tested comparing representative samples of Russian immigrants in Norway and their stay-at-home counterparts. Data from the Russian population came from the 2008 GEM study, while data on Russian immigrants in Norway were collected through a specially designed postal survey. The analysis revealed some demographic dissimilarity between the two groups, as well as a presence of selective migration with respect to entrepreneurial characteristics. This study demonstrates that immigrants (as compared to non-migrants) are more likely to report intentions to start a business. Moreover, they possess relatively large amount of specific human capital, social capital and self-confidence relevant for entrepreneurship. The paper concludes with proposed practical implications and suggestions for further research. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.","brain drain; Entrepreneurship; immigration; Russian; selective migration; self-employment",,,,,,,,10849467,,,"English","J.

However, since formal laws can be observed to varying degrees, the actual enforcement regime shapes incentives and constraints. Most of the studies exploring the effects of employment protection on labor market performance implicitly assume that compliance is near to complete. However, if enforcement varies widely across regions/cities or segments of firms, then this variation may cause variation in performance. This paper, looking at Russia, explores whether cross-regional and inter-temporal variation in enforcement of employment protection laws is significant and is translated into regional labor market outcomes.

We formalize similarity by a tolerance relation: objects are grouped within a same concept when having similar descriptions, extending the ability of FCA to deal with complex data. We propose two different approaches. A first classical manner defines a discretization procedure. A second way consists in representing data by pattern structures, from which a pattern concept lattice can be constructed directly. In this case, considering a tolerance relation can be mathematically defined by a projection in a meet-semi-lattice. This allows to use concept lattices for their knowledge representation and reasoning abilities without transforming data. We show finally that resulting lattices are useful for solving information fusion problems. © 2010 ACM.","Experimentation; Management; Theory","Complex data; Concept Lattices; Discretizations; Experimentation; Formal Concept Analysis; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Pattern structure; Similarity relations; Theory; Tolerance relations; Use concept; Information analysis; Information fusion; Knowledge management; Metadata; Knowledge representation","ACM SIGIR;ACM SIGWEB;ACM SIGKDD",,"19th International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management and Co-located Workshops, CIKM'10","26 October 2010 through 30 October 2010","Toronto, ON",82879,,9781450300995,,"English","Int Conf Inf Knowledge Manage",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651305995

This post-World War II accumulation of hard multilateral and soft plurilateral institutions by no means constitutes a comprehensive, coherent and effective system of global economic governance. As intensifying globalization thrusts many longstanding domestic issues onto the international stage, there is a growing need to create at the global level the more comprehensive, coherent and effective governance system that citizens have long taken for granted at home. This book offers the first comprehensive look at this critical question of international relations. It examines how, and how well, the multilateral organizations and the G8 are dealing with the central challenges facing the contemporary international community, how they have worked well and poorly together, and how they can work together more effectively to provide badly needed public goods. It is an ideal reference guide for anyone interested in institutions of global governance. © John Kirton, Marina Larionova and Paolo Savona 2010.

They enumerate ramified coverings of two-dimensional surfaces. They also have many other manifestations: as connection coefficients in symmetric groups, as numbers enumerating certain classes of graphs, as Gromov-Witten invariants of complex curves. Hurwitz numbers belong to a tribe of numerical sequences that penetrate the whole body of mathematics, like multinomial coefficients. They are indexed by partitions, or, more generally, by tuples of partitions, which does not allow one to overview all of them simultaneously. Instead, we usually deal with some of their specific subsequences. The Cayley numbers NN-1 enumerating rooted trees on N marked vertices is may be the simplest such instance. The corresponding exponential generating series has been considered by Euler and he gave it the name of Lambert function. Certain series of Hurwitz numbers can be expressed by nice explicit formulas, and the corresponding generating functions provide solutions to integrable hierarchies of mathematical physics. The paper surveys recent progress in understanding Hurwitz numbers.","Gromov-Witten invariants; Hurwitz numbers; KP hierarchy; Moduli space of curves; Permutations; Ramified covering; Riemann surface","Gromov-Witten invariants; Hurwitz numbers; KP hierarchy; Moduli space; Permutations; Ramified covering; Riemann surfaces; Geometry; Two dimensional",,,"International Congress of Mathematicians 2010, ICM 2010","19 August 2010 through 27 August 2010","Hyderabad",96943,,9814324302; 9789814324304,,"English","Proc.

Firstly, the paper grounds the possibility of using a mathematical model being the kernel of the theory of K-representations and describing a system of 10 partial operations on conceptual structures for building semantic representations (or text meaning representations) of, likely, arbitrary sentences and discourses in English, Russian, French, German, and other languages. The possibilities of using SK-languages defined by the theory of K-representations for building semantic annotations of informational sources and for constructing semantic representations of discourses pertaining to biology and medicine are illustrated. Secondly, an original strategy of transforming the existing Web into a Semantic Web of a new generation with the well-developed mechanisms of understanding natural language texts is described. The third subject of this paper is a description of the correspondence between the inputs and outputs of the elaborated algorithm of semantic-syntactic analysis and of its advantages; the semantic representations of the input texts are the expressions of SK-languages (standard knowledge languages). The input texts can be the statements, questions, and commands from the sublanguages of English, Russian, and German.

The scalability means that schedules are formed for job models with various levels of task granularity, data replication policies, and the processor resource and memory can be upgraded. The necessity of guaranteed job execution at the required quality of service causes taking into account the distributed environment dynamics, namely, changes in the number of jobs for servicing, volumes of computations, possible failures of processor nodes, etc. As a consequence, in the general case, a set of versions of scheduling, or a strategy, is required instead of a single version. We propose a scalable model of scheduling based on multicriteria strategies. The choice of the specific schedule depends on the load level of the resource dynamics and is formed as a resource query which is sent to a local batch-job management system.","Co-scheduling; Critical work; Distributed computing; Job; Scalability; Strategy; Task","Co-scheduling; Critical work; Distributed Computing; Job; Strategy; Task; Computer applications; Network security; Quality of service; Scalability; Scheduling",,,"2010 ACS/IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications, AICCSA 2010","16 May 2010 through 19 May 2010","Hammamet",82220,,9781424477159,,"English","ACS/IEEE Int.

The components of the structure are supplied with fuzzy membership profiles over the taxonomy. Our method generalizes the profiles in two steps: first, by fuzzy clustering, and then by mapping the clusters to higher ranks of the taxonomy. To be specific, we concentrate on the Computer Sciences area represented by the taxonomy of ACM Computing Classification System (ACM-CCS). We build fuzzy clusters of the taxonomy leaves according to the similarity between individual profiles by using a novel, additive spectral, fuzzy clustering method that, in contrast to other methods, involves a number of model-based stopping conditions. The clusters are not necessarily consistent with the taxonomy. This is formalized by a novel method for parsimoniously elevating them to higher ranks of the taxonomy using an original recursive algorithm for minimizing a penalty function that involves ""head subjects"" on the higher ranks of the taxonomy along with their ""gaps"" and ""offshoots"".

The position of the centrosome within the cell is important in such directional activities as wound closure and interactions of immune cells. Here we analyzed the centrosome positioning as it is dictated by microtubule elasticity alone in a mechanical model of an intrinsically fully symmetric microtubule aster. We demonstrate that the symmetry and the central position of the centrosome are unstable. The equilibrium deviation of the centrosome from the center is approximately proportional to the difference of the microtubule length and cell radius. The proportionality coefficient is 1 in flat cells and 2 in three-dimensional cells. The loss of symmetry is irreversible, and in general, the equilibrium form of the aster exhibits memory of past perturbations. The equilibrium position of the centrosome as a function of the microtubule length exhibits hysteresis, and the history of the length variation is reflected in the aster form. These properties of the simple aster of elastic microtubules must be taken into account in the analysis of more comprehensive theoretical models, and in the design and interpretation of experiments addressing the complex process of cytoskeleton morphogenesis. © 2010 by the Biophysical Society.",,,,"Biophysical Society",,,,,00063495,,BIOJA,"English","Biophys.

Three measures of discernibility are proposed and experimentally compared with each other and with more conventional techniques based on the classification scores for class labels. The classification accuracy can be significantly enhanced through discernibility measures using the most reliable - 'elite' - patterns. It can be further boosted by forming an amalgamation of the elites of different classifiers. Improved performance is achieved at the price of rejecting many patterns. There are situations in which this price is worth paying - when the non-reliable predictions, however good, lead to the need for the manual testing of very cumbersome and complex technical devices or in diagnostics of human terminal diseases. Contrary to conventional techniques for estimating reliability, the proposed measures are applicable to small datasets as well as to datasets with complex class structures on which conventional classifiers show low accuracy rates. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","combining classifiers; discernibility; pattern recognition; rejection; reliability elite","Accuracy rate; Class labels; Classification accuracy; Combining classifiers; Complex class; Conventional classifier; Conventional techniques; Data sets; Discernibility; Multiple classifiers; Novel methods; rejection; Small data set; Metals; Pattern recognition; Reliability; Classifiers",,,,,,,03081079,,IJGSA,"English","Int J Gen Syst",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957911244

It is not just a substitute for bank loans: it has proven to be a more efficient way of financing projects at different stages. On one hand, venture financing allows for projects with higher risk, which leads to the possibility of higher returns on investment. On the other hand, venture investors who usually have managerial experience often participate in governing the business, which certainly adds value to the enterprise. In this paper we establish the model of contract between the venture capital fund and the entrepreneur, focusing on probably the most important issue of this contract: the shares of the parties in the business. The shares in the company determine the distribution of the joint surplus. The expected joint profits are not just exogenously specified in the contract but are dependent on the behavioural variables of both parties at the stage of fulfilling the contract. We call the behavioural variable of the entrepreneur 'effort' and the one of the venture fund 'advice'. The probability of the project's success, and hence the expected joint revenues, are increased by these two. However, both kinds of effort are costly to the respective parties that have made them. Based on this fact we can elaborate the profit functions of both sides of the contract. Our model can be considered as a basis for specifying contracts concerning venture financing. It can provide the logic for how the equilibrium shares of entrepreneur and venture fund are obtained.","Contract shares; Costly effort; Entrepreneur; Profit functions; Value added; Venture capital; Venture fund",,,,,,,,00133264,,,"English","Econ.

Specimens that exhibit a plateau on their time-of-flight curves were selected for the study, since they suggest the occurrence of quasi-equilibrium transport in the system according to the conventional point of view. In the extremely small signal mode, current transients in the case of bulk irradiation have a form corresponding to dispersive, rather than Gaussian, transport, although hole movement is observed in the presence of charged sites (trapped electrons). On passing to the moderately large signal mode (preirradiation to a dose of up to 5 Gy), the current transients undergo noticeable changes, which might be mistakenly interpreted as evidence for the influence of charged sites on hole transport in accordance with the predictions of the dipolar glass theory. In actuality, these changes are due to the effect of a space charge field and the hole mobility remains almost unchanged in this case. The appearance of the plateau on the current transients is an artifact of the procedure, and the hole transport is dispersive. © 2010 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,,,,,,,00181439,,HIECA,"English","High Energy Chem.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956556829

Since the beginning of the transition period, Russian industrial firms have been widely reporting that the quantity and composition of hired labour is far from being close to optimal. This paper discusses what kinds of firms in the Russian manufacturing sector are unable to optimize their employment and why. The main conclusion is that the key issue is an excess of non-viable firms and a shortage of highly efficient firms because of weak selection mechanisms. The major solution is seen in creating institutional conditions that stimulate a more efficient reallocation of labour.

For any Harish-Chandra pair (D,G) where D is a sheaf of twisted differential operators on X, we form a left ideal D g ∑ D generated by the Lie algebra g = Lie G. Then, D/D g is a holonomic D-module, and its restriction to a unique Zariski open dense G-orbit in X is a G-equivariant local system. We prove a criterion saying that the D-module D/D g is isomorphic, under certain (quite restrictive) conditions, to a direct image of that local system to X. We apply this criterion in the special case of the group G = SLn acting diagonally on X = B × B × ℙ n-1, where B denotes the flag manifold for SLn. We further relate D-modules on to B × B × ℙn-1 to D-modules on the Cartesian product SLn × ℙn-1 via a pair, of adjoint functors analogous to those used in Lusztig's theory of character sheaves.

This article examines whether there are any symptoms of the Dutch disease in Russia. Using a variety of Rosstat publications and the CHELEM database, we analyse the trends in production, wages and employment in Russian manufacturing industries, and we study the behaviour of Russian imports and exports. We find that, while Russia exhibits some symptoms of the Dutch disease, e.g. the real appreciation of the ruble, the rise in real wages, the decrease in employment in manufacturing industries and the development of the services sector, manufacturing production nonetheless increased, contradicting the theory of the Dutch disease. These trends can be explained by the gains in productivity and the recovery after the disorganisation in the 1990s, by new market opportunities for Russian products in the European Union and in CIS countries, by a growing Chinese demand for some products and by a booming internal market. Finally, investment in many manufacturing industries was largely encouraged, whereas investment in the energy sector was strongly regulated, which contributed to economic diversification. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",,"economic development; economic diversification; economic growth; export; import; manufacturing; resource use; Russian Federation",,,,,,,14631377,,PCECF,"English","Post-Communist Econ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955374104

In their recent paper they undertake an attempt to use the notion of gift in the analysis of principal-agent relationship and to generalize the idea of gift in order to obtain a theory of gift exchange in the workplace. However, the analysis suggested lacks conceptual clarity and rests upon false presuppositions regarding the nature of gift. As a result, authors draw erroneous conclusions and fall victims of the magic of the gift. This short reply points to these deficiencies and suggests some ideas for alternative approaches to the analysis of certain phenomena observed in the workplace. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The work suggests that convergence to an electoral center (often predicted by electoral models) is a nongeneric phenomenon. In an attempt to explain nonconvergence, a formal model based on intrinsic valence is presented. This theory showed that there are necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence. The necessary condition is that a convergence coefficient c is bounded above by the dimension w of the policy space, while a sufficient condition is that the coefficient is bounded above by 1. This coefficient is defined in terms of the difference in exogenous valences, the spatial coefficient, and the electoral variance. The theoretical model is then applied to empirical analyses of elections in the United States and Britain. These empirical models include sociodemographic valence and electoral perceptions of character trait. It is shown that the model implies convergence to positions close to the electoral origin. To explain party divergence, the model is then extended to incorporate activist valences. This extension gives a first-order balance condition that allows the party to calculate the optimal marginal condition to maximize vote share. We argue that the equilibrium positions of presidential candidates in US elections and by party leaders in British elections are principally due to the influence of activists, rather than the centripetal effect of the electorate.

In this paper, data obtained from a new experimental variant of the time-of-flight (TOF) technique, called TOF1a, are compared to the predictions of a two-layer multiple trapping model (MTM) with an exponential distribution of traps. In the recently introduced TOF1a experimental variant, the charge generation depth is varied continuously, from surface generation to bulk generation, by varying the energy of the electron-beam excitation source. This produces systematic changes in the shape of the current transient that can be compared to predictions of the two-layer MTM. In the model, one additional assumption is added to the homogeneous MTM, namely: that there exists a surface region, on the order of a micrometer thick, in which the trap distribution is identical to the bulk, but has a higher trap concentration. We find that the characteristic experimental features of an initial spike, a flat plateau, and an anomalously broad tail, as well as the sometimes observed cusp or decreasing current occurring near the transit time, can all be described by such a two-layer model; that is, they can arise as a result of carriers delayed by a trap-rich surface layer. We find that we can semiquantitatively fit current transient data over the whole time range of the experiment, but only by using theoretical parameters that lie in a narrow range, the extent of which we quantify here. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Charge generation; Charge transport; Current transients; Electron beam excitation; Exponential distributions; Molecularly doped polymers; Multiple trapping; Surface generations; Surface layers; Surface region; Systematic changes; Time range; Time-of-flight techniques; Transit time; Trap concentration; Trap distributions; Trapping model; Two layer model; Two layers; Forecasting; Polymers",,,,,,,19327447,,,"English","J.

For films with a lower dopant concentration, such a categorical statement cannot be made, because mobility can either decrease as the film thickness increases or remain almost unchanged depending on the method for data processing.

(For simplicity, we only consider the untwisted and simply connected case here.) The usual geometric Satake isomorphism for a reductive group G identifies the tensor category Rep(Gv) of finite-dimensional representations of the Langlands dual group Gv with the tensor category PervG(O) (GrG) of G(O)-equivariant perverse sheaves on the affine Grassmannian GrG = G(K )/G(O) of G. (Here K = C((t )) and O = C[[t ]].) As a by-product one gets a description of the irreducible G(O)-equivariant intersection cohomology (IC) sheaves of the closures of G(O)-orbits in GrG in terms of q-analogs of the weight multiplicity for finite-dimensional representations of Gv. The purpose of this article is to try to generalize the above results to the case when G is replaced by the corresponding affine Kac-Moody group Gaff. (We refer to the (not yet constructed) affine Grassmannian of Gaff as the double affine Grassmannian.) More precisely, in this article we construct certain varieties that should be thought of as transversal slices to various Gaff (O)-orbits inside the closure of another Gaff (O)-orbit in GrGaff. We present a conjecture that computes the intersection cohomology sheaf of these varieties in terms of the corresponding q -analog of the weight multiplicity for the Langlands dual affine group Gv aff, and we check this conjecture in a number of cases. Some further constructions (such as convolution of the corresponding perverse sheaves, analog of the Beilinson-Drinfeld Grassmannian, and so forth) will be addressed in another publication. © 2010.",,,,,,,,,00127094,,,"English","Duke Math.

European sociologists rely heavily on such an informative descriptor as occupation, which has become institutionalized and thus produces certain requirements of human, social and cultural resources for individuals to perform the underlying functions. However, this indicator manifests at least two substantial restrictions: first, it is natural that certain types of economic activity are historically less stable than the social classes with which they are associated; and second, Russian history demonstrates that in a developed society the system of occupations is consistent with its institutional set-up and system of values, which are transferred from generation to generation. In Russia specific occupations are associated with a certain character of labour yet not with particular status characteristics that should result from the corporate nature of professional associations.

Cluster intermix appears to be a factor most affecting the clustering results. This paper proposes an experimental setting for comparison of different approaches at data generated from Gaussian clusters with the controlled parameters of between- and within-cluster spread to model cluster intermix. The setting allows for evaluating the centroid recovery on par with conventional evaluation of the cluster recovery. The subjects of our interest are two versions of the ""intelligent"" K-Means method, ik-Means, that find the ""right"" number of clusters by extracting ""anomalous patterns"" from the data one-by-one. We compare them with seven other methods, including Hartigan's rule, averaged Silhouette width and Gap statistic, under different between- and within-cluster spread-shape conditions. There are several consistent patterns in the results of our experiments, such as that the right K is reproduced best by Hartigan's rule - but not clusters or their centroids. This leads us to propose an adjusted version of iK-Means, which performs well in the current experiment setting. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Anomalous pattern; Gap statistic; Hartigan's rule; K-Means clustering; Number of clusters",,,,,,,,01764268,,,"English","J.

That's the general point that Johansen (IPBS: Integrative Psychological & Behavioral Science 44, 2010) makes which is of great importance. Fictional abstractions use to make the point even more salient. As an example I've examined Borges' famous fiction story. Along with the examples of Johansen it provides an informative case of exploring symbolic mechanisms which bind meaning with emotions. This particular mode of analysis draws forth poetry and literature in general to be treated as a ""meaningful life laboratory"". Ways of explanation of emotional effect the art exercises on people, which had been disclosed within this laboratory, however, constitute a significant distinction in terms that I have designated as ""referential"" and ""substantive"". The former appeals to something that has already been charged with emotional power, whereas the latter comes to effect by means of special symbolic mechanisms creating the emotional experience within the situation. Johansen, who tends to explain emotions exerted by the art without leaving the semiotic perspective, is drawn towards the ""referential"" type of explanation. Based upon discussions in theory of metaphor and Robert Witkin's sociological theory of arts it is demonstrated an insufficient of ""referential"" explanation. To overcome a monopoly of ""referential"" explanation of emotional engagement, in particular, in literature, means to break away from the way of reasoning, stating endless references to ""something else"", presupposing the existence of something already significant and therefore sharing its effects. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Aesthetic; Arts; Emotion; Meaning; Memory; Metaphor; Perceptional mode; Poetic device; Sacred; Symbolic","emotion; human; literature; memory; physiology; Emotions; Humans; Literature; Memory; Poetry as Topic",,"Springer New York",,,,,19324502,,,"English","Integr.

The problem of service integration challenges modern companies dared to implement SOA. One of important aspects of this problem relates to service composition, which has to take into account many types of information and restrictions existing in each enterprise. Moreover, all the changes in business logic should also be promptly reflected. This paper proposes the approach to solution of the stated problem based on such concepts as MDA, ontology modeling and logical analysis. The approach consists of several steps of modeling and finite scope logical analysis for automated translation of business processes into the sequence of service invocations. Formal language of relational logic is proposed as a key element of the proposed approach which is responsible for logical analysis and service workflow generation. Our approach is worked out and realized using MIT Alloy Analyzer software. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.","MDA; MIT Alloy Analyzer; Ontology; Relational logic; Service composition; Service integration; SOA; Web services",,,"EuroJournals, Inc.",,,,,1450216X,,,"English","Eur.

A special attention is paid to the crisis (2008-2009) impact both on the entrepreneurial activity of population based on Global Entrepreneurship Monitors (GEM) data as well as on the State inconsistent policy to promote SME under slowdown. In Russia, the strategic objective of government policies must be to support productive entrepreneurship and limit the options for rent-oriented or even parasitic growth of the two other types. But this task involves fundamental changes in the system of ownership rights and the entire structure of social relations, for the domination of unproductive and 'destructive' entrepreneurship is inseparable from the system of 'power-ownership' dominating in Russia.","Crisis' impact; Early entrepreneurial activity; Russia; Small entrepreneurship; Sme and entrepreneurship policy",,,"GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences",,,,,01726404,,,"English","Hist.

A (metric) modular on a set X is a function w : (0, ∞) × X × X → [0, ∞] satisfying, for all x, y, z ∈ X, the following three properties: x = y if and only if w (λ, x, y) = 0 for all λ &gt; 0; w (λ, x, y) = w (λ, y, x) for all λ &gt; 0; w (λ + μ, x, y) ≤ w (λ, x, z) + w (μ, y, z) for all λ, μ &gt; 0. We show that, given x0 ∈ X, the set Xw = {x ∈ X : limλ → ∞ w (λ, x, x0) = 0} is a metric space with metric dw{ring operator} (x, y) = inf {λ &gt; 0 : w (λ, x, y) ≤ λ}, called a modular space. The modular w is said to be convex if (λ, x, y) {mapping} λ w (λ, x, y) is also a modular on X. In this case Xw coincides with the set of all x ∈ X such that w (λ, x, x0) &lt; ∞ for some λ = λ (x) &gt; 0 and is metrizable by dw* (x, y) = inf {λ &gt; 0 : w (λ, x, y) ≤ 1}. Moreover, if dw{ring operator} (x, y) &lt; 1 or dw* (x, y) &lt; 1, then (dw{ring operator} (x, y))2 ≤ dw* (x, y) ≤ dw{ring operator} (x, y); otherwise, the reverse inequalities hold.

Unlike countries like China, India, Brazil, Singapore, Taiwan and other emerging markets, Russia lacks the economic incentive scheme to translate new discoveries into viable products and services. The tradition of a high level of concentration of research activities in specialised public and private research and development (R&D) centres separates new technology developments from market forces and customer needs. According to a recent OECD Innovation Policy Review (2011) Russia still suffers from a system where innovation is not firm-specific and the lack of competition undermines the economic incentives for innovation. Russia also faces an ageing cohort of scientists and increasing global competition for both innovation and talent, and lacks market orientation in firm-level innovation investments. In this chapter we explore how Russian multinational corporations (MNCs) address their innovation needs, provide an overview of how they operate within the Russian innovation system and examine case studies of Russian firms which have broken out of the bounds of their domestic system and utilised innovation-driven strategies in their firm-level internationalisation.Innovation is universally recognised as a competitive advantage and a key driver of growth of multinational companies. Presently, innovation is not limited to Western multinationals, emerging multinational companies are realising the strategic value of innovation too. Among emerging multinationals, Russian companies represent an interesting case. Russia inherited the Soviet science and technology (S&T) complex that enjoyed success in many technological domains. However, the institutional collapse after the break-up of the Soviet Union had a profound effect on innovation, science and technology. Since the early 2000s the Russian economy has been widely acknowledged to be dependent on natural resource production. © Cambridge University Press 2013.",,,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9781139506694; 9781107032552,,"English","The Competitive Advant. of Emerg.

We construct generalizations of the minimal dominating set and find out, with their help, how the system of dominating sets looks like in the general case. We formulate a criterion that determines whether an alternative belongs to a minimal weakly stable set. We find out how minimal weakly stable sets relate to uncovered sets.

The immediate pretext for this dispute was the 1836 publication of a “philosophical letter” by Pëtr Chaadaev (1794–1856), a thinker who argued that Russia had never belonged either to the West or to the East, that it lacked the traditions of these other civilizations, and that therefore “we [Russians] have not been touched by the universal education of the human race.” The young Aleksandr Herzen described Chaadaev's letter as a “pistol shot resounding in the dead of night,” a “pitiless cry of pain and reproach to Petrine Russia.” By the late 1830s, largely in response to Chaadaev's provocative letter, two intellectual parties took shape, each holding a different view of the historical-cultural differences between Russia and the West. After a time, these parties came to be known as the “Westerners” or “Westernizers” (zapadniki) and the “Slavophiles” (slavianofily). The Westernizers considered the differences between Russia and the West to be manifestations of Russia's cultural backwardness; they thought the paradigm of western civilization universal, and believed Russia's task was to adopt completely the western paradigm and to assimilate European culture along with it. By contrast, the Slavophiles held that the historical-cultural differences between Russia and the West indicated Russia's superiority and the radically different nature of Russian society and history. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",,,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9780511712227; 9780521884501,,"English","A History of Russian Philosophy 1830-1930: Faith, Reason, and the Def. of Hum.

From the informatics and the software points of view these problems are linked to the image processing and creating of the compression algorithms applicable for the video array frames obtained by standard registration systems. Compression solutions become crucially important when the temporal evolution of the video stream exceeds the traffic capacity of the communication network. All algorithms and methods known and exploited nowadays are unable to meet the reliable security requirements. The MPEG and the MPEG4 compression codes distort the initial image. Fragmentation or splitting the video stream into separate frames with the subsequent application of the ordinary DCT or DWT procedures provides better compression rate, but the quality of the image still remains rather poor with no chance for creating a justified and documented personal identification protocol. The main research objective of this paper is providing significant reduction of the information traffic within a standard security registration system (a network of about 10 cameras and microphones relayed to an operating server) possibly maintaining the highest quality of records in the server. The basic image processing approach we exploited is to maintain of the highest resolution degree for the main part of the object we survey (for example man's face or figure) whilst minimizing the information traffic from the image background by its artificial substitution with a homogeneous color filling. This method allowed obtaining significant compression rate already (up to 7000) and presently we are carrying on even more promising studies on this subject. ©2009 IEEE.","Color allocation; Contour segregation; Image compression; Video compression; Video registration","Anti-terrorist; Communication networks; Compression algorithms; Compression codes; Compression rates; Compression solutions; Contour segregation; Effective tool; Highest resolutions; Informatics; Information traffic; Personal identification; Registration systems; Research objectives; Security requirements; Temporal evolution; Traffic capacity; Video array; Video compression; Video registration; Video streams; Color; Computer software selection and evaluation; Digital image storage; Hydraulics; Image compression; Imaging systems; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Segregation (metallography); Software engineering; Terrorism; Video streaming; Wavelet transforms; Data compression",,,"2009 5th Central and Eastern European Software Engineering Conference in Russia, CEE-SECR 2009","28 October 2009 through 29 October 2009","Moscow",81324,,9781424456659,,"English","Cent.

Previously described redundancy effects have mainly been associated with relatively high-level perception. The present study examines whether redundancy effects exist in basic attentional and perceptual systems, such as alerting and orienting. Participants performed speeded detection of briefly presented targets while ignoring moving distractors. The presence/absence of distractors and their spatial relationships with targets were manipulated to dissociate possible alerting and orienting redundancies. The distractor pathway (straightforward vs. chaotic) and its motion predictability (blocked vs. intermixed sequences of straightforward and chaotic trials) were also manipulated. The presence of a distractor resulted in faster responses (alerting redundancy). Furthermore, participants responded faster to targets behind distractors (orienting redundancy). Orienting redundancy was found only in the straightforward condition. This indicates that generating an orienting redundancy effect is a relatively slow process based on continuous observation of motion. Lastly, a blocked sequence of trials improved the alerting redundancy effect in comparison with an intermixed sequence. © 2009 The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",,"adolescent; adult; article; association; attention; female; human; learning; male; movement perception; orientation; pattern recognition; perception; perceptive discrimination; psychomotor performance; psychophysics; reaction time; Adolescent; Attention; Cues; Discrimination (Psychology); Female; Humans; Male; Motion Perception; Orientation; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Practice (Psychology); Psychomotor Performance; Psychophysics; Reaction Time; Size Perception; Young Adult",,,,,,,19433921,,,"English","Atten.

In case of data more complex than binary to apply FCA techniques, one needs scaling (binarizing) data. Pattern structures propose a direct way of processing complex data such as strings, graphs, numerical intervals and other. As compared to scaling (binarization), this way is more efficient from the computational point of view and proposes much better vizualization of results. General definition of pattern structures and learning by means of them is given. Two particular cases, namely that of graph pattern structures and interval pattern structures are considered.

They explore the methods of self treatment and illness prevention in combination with the effects poverty and treatment availability can have on the standards of living for the people surveyed. This pertinent issue follows a time of rapidly worsening health status amongst the Russian population and a grave decline in male life expectancy.

Solutions of such problems can be expressed by means of algebraic functions. The goal of this paper is to describe a procedure for determining the algebraic equation for this function in the case when the genus of this algebraic function is equal zero. Using the coefficients of the equation we compute the extremal cuts of the Riemann surfaces. These cuts are attractive sets for the poles of the Hermite-Padé approximants. We demonstrate the method by an example of the equilibrium problem related to a special system that is called the Angelesco system. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Trechsvyatitel. per., Moscow, Russian Federation","The elucidation of the charge transport mechanism in molecularly doped polymers MDP has been confused by disagreement on the role of disorder, which has led to disagreement on how to analyze the experimental mobility data. Plotting the mobility vs. T-1 or T-2 where T is temperature gives an Arrhenius activation energy or disorder energy respectively, which cannot be compared. A methodology is suggested to convert disorder energies into activation energies. This allows a compilation of a list of the activation energies of all MDP's which have been characterized as a function of dopant concentration and a correlation of the activation energies with material properties. In addition, it is argued that the intrinsic mobility in MDP's is activated with an activation energy that is independent of dopant concentration, and has a pre-factor which is exponential in ρ, the calculated distance between dopant molecules, as expected for a hoping theory. The experimental observations of other behaviors, activation energies that depend on ρ and pre-factors independent of ρ, are attributed to either interactions among the dopant molecules or the failure of the lattice gas model to properly calculate ρ at high dopant concentrations. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The fact that architecture of the computational environment is distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic along with autonomy of processor nodes, makes it much more difficult to manage and assign resources for job execution which fulfils user expectations for quality of service (QoS). The strategies are implemented using a combination of job-flow and application-level techniques of scheduling and resource co-allocation. Strategy is considered as a set of possible job scheduling variants with a coordinated allocation of the tasks to the processor nodes. Applications are regarded as compound jobs with a complex structure containing several tasks. The choice of the specific scheduling depends on the load level of the resource dynamics and is formed as a resource request, which is sent to a local batch-job management system.",,"Co-allocation; Complex structure; Computational environments; Distributed Computing; Integrated approach; Job execution; Job management system; Job scheduling; Load levels; Processor nodes; Resource request; Scheduling strategies; User expectations; Computer architecture; Coordination reactions; Distributed computer systems; Quality control; Quality of service; Scheduling",,,"2009 4th International Conference on Dependability of Computer Systems, DepCos-RELCOMEX 2009","30 June 2009 through 2 July 2009","Brunow",78440,,9780769536743,,"English","Proc.

We show that, given an arbitrary signature, there is a variety of algebras of this signature such that the free algebra of the variety contains polylinear elements of arbitrarily large degree, while the clone of every such element satisfies some nontrivial identity. If, in addition, the number of binary operations is at least 2, then each such clone may be assumed to be finite-dimensional. Our approach is the following: we cast the problem in the language of operads and then apply the usual homological constructions in order to adopt Golod's solution to the original Kurosh problem.

The controlled increase in the thickness of the generation layer from 0.5 to 7-10 μm practiced in the new method is supposed to unambiguously answer whether the plateau indicates the establishment of quasi-equilibrium transport or is an artifact due to the unaccounted effect of the surface layer at the electrode/polymer interface. On the example of polycarbonate doped with 30 wt % DEH hydrazone, it has been shown that the plateau on the transit curves recorded by the classical time-of-flight method is an artifact of the procedure, rather than the result of the attaining of quasi-equilibrium transport, which is dispersive under the given experimental conditions. This conclusion is in serious conflict with the conventional point of view in the literature. © 2009 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,"Current transients; Electronic transport; Experimental conditions; Hydrazones; Molecularly doped polymers; Physical nature; Quasi-equilibrium; Surface layers; Time-of-flight method; Time-of-flight techniques; Variable thickness",,,,,,,0965545X,,,"English","Polym.

It emphasizes the Russian NIS structure and subsequent positioning of universities and the research institutions of the Academy of Sciences. The analysis makes it evident that the innovation activity of Russian universities is strongly challenged by various interdependent hampering factors. These factors arise directly from traditional barriers between science and education, which in turn relate to the imperfection of Russia's NIS originating from deep structural breaches far beyond S&T and education activities. National policies nowadays are aimed at increasing the innovation activity of universities, and the article concludes with an overview of the current debate on the most urgent issues. © Beech Tree Publishing 2009.",,"academic research; innovation; science and technology; university sector; Eurasia; Russian Federation",,,,,,,03023427,,,"English","Sci.

This allows one to determine the temperature by recording the emission spectrum and comparing it to a Planck spectrum. Experimental or calculated data on the emissivity of such objects are not necessary because the temperature is determined as a parameter of the distribution observed. This property characterizes the emission spectra of gaseous and solid-phase flames, erosion plasmas of surface discharges, metals, semiconductors, dielectrics, micro- and nanoparticles, and heterogeneous media (powder mixtures and ceramics) at temperatures both lower and higher than the melting temperature. Spectrometers with photodetector arrays sensitive in the wavelength range of 200-1100 nm are used to record spectra. Such spectrometers allow spectrum recording and determination of the radiator temperature in the temperature range of 800 K-140 kK within a time of ∼ 1 ms. The specific features of the method, examples of its application, measurement characteristics, unsolved problems, and prospects are discussed in the review. © 2009 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,"Emission spectrums; Erosion plasma; Heterogeneous media; Intensity distribution; Measurement characteristics; Melting temperatures; Photo detector array; Powder mixtures; Radiator temperature; Solid-phase; Spectrum recording; Temperature range; Unsolved problems; Wavelength ranges; Melting point; Optoelectronic devices; Smelting; Spectrometers; Spectrometry; Surface discharges; Water pollution; Emission spectroscopy",,,,,,,00204412,,,"English","Instrum.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper sheds light on the network organisational forms recently implanted in the academic community. the analytic induction method is used to extend b2b network concepts to a non-profit context. The concepts of b2b networks are critically analysed and applied to explorative case studies of networks in academia. The paradox of open knowledge exchange in these networks is revealed and an attempt is made to elucidate it. Findings - B2b network concepts should be modified before being extended to non-profits. Propositions are suggested to adapt b2b network concepts to explain non-profit networks. Questions to address in further research are developed. Research limitations/implications - The main conclusions are only applicable to specific types of networks. Only academic networks are reviewed. The case study approach does not allow for generalizing the findings and deriving a set of concepts for non-profit networks, and thus, calls for further research. Practical implications - There may be space for achieving excellence in research by facilitating interpersonal rather than interorganisational research networks. This is important, since by facilitating interpersonal networks one can escape from organisational bureaucracy. Originality/value - The study reports networking between the non-profits, an issue largely neglected by marketing researchers, and contributes to its understanding in the frame of existing b2b network concepts. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","European Union; Knowledge management; Networking; Russia",,,,,,,,08858624,,,"English","J.

In this paper we review recent advances in the examination of implicit nationalism. In the first set of experiments we survey, the Palestinian, Israeli, Italian, and Russian flags were primed (or not, in the control conditions) and their effects on political thought and behavior were tested. In the second set the American or the Israeli flag was primed (or not) and prejudice toward African-Americans or Palestinians (respectively) was examined. The results of all experiments suggest that the implicit activation of national cues has far-reaching implications on political thought and behavior as well as on attitudes toward minorities. Under the assumption that the image of national flags is associated in memory with national ideologies, these results suggest that national ideologies can be implicitly pursued in a way that significantly affects our thoughts and behaviors. © 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.","Flag; National ideology; Nonconscious; Priming","accuracy; African American; Arab; cognition; conference paper; human; ideology; Israel; Italy; memory; minority group; motivation; political participation; Russian Federation; social behavior; social psychology; sociology; Humans; Prejudice; Social Behavior; Precis",,,,,,,00778923,9781573317603,ANYAA,"English","Ann.

Using a q-version of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem we construct an extension of the algebra of differential operators on SL q (n) (otherwise called the Heisenberg double) by spectral values of the matrix of right invariant vector fields. We consider two applications for the spectral extension. First, we describe the extended Heisenberg double in terms of a new set of generators-the Weyl partners of the spectral variables. Calculating defining relations in terms of these generators allows us to derive SL q (n) type dynamical R-matrices in a surprisingly simple way. Second, we calculate an evolution operator for the model of the q-deformed isotropic top introduced by A.Alekseev and L.Faddeev. The evolution operator is not uniquely defined and we present two possible expressions for it. The first one is a Riemann theta function in the spectral variables. The second one is an almost free motion evolution operator in terms of logarithms of the spectral variables. The relation between the two operators is given by a modular functional equation for the Riemann theta function. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,,,,00103616,,,"English","Commun. Math.

For this purpose we propose a new variant of the time-of-flight technique which allows easy changing of the generation zone width from about 0.5 νm (surface excitation) through intermediate values to full sample thickness (bulk excitation). To achieve this, we use electron pulses of 3-50 keV energy rather than traditional light pulses provided by lasers. Experimental results corroborated by numerical calculations uniquely prove that carrier transport in this molecularly doped polymer is dispersive, with the dispersion parameter equal to 0.75.

Three pathways for further research on the basis of Zentella's model are suggested: the study of possibilities of collective subjectivity, identity and social movement formation; the study of heterogeneous constitution of space by multiple populations; and the study of issues of justice and reconciliation.

Newly discovered data from the Russian State Archive of Economics allow us to close this gap and to compare mortality trends in urban Latvia and several urban areas of Russia with the concentration of rising male mortality among manual workers already found in several eastern European countries. A similar trend appears in these data for rising mortality to concentrate among manual workers over time. Unfavorable trends in the life expectancy of the total population were largely driven by mortality increase among manual workers. Possible determinants of the pattern include a special type of economic growth in the USSR in the 1970s and 1980s associated with dominance of heavy industries and military sector, and low consumer goods' production, high prevalence of hard manual labor, massive rural-urban migrations and poor living conditions of new coming industrial workers, growing psychosocial stress and high prevalence of adverse health behaviors.

These data are plotted using both linear - linear and log - log axes. The plots on linear - linear axes give familiar results: an initial spike followed by a relatively flat current before the transit time; a mobility that equals published values and precisely follows the Poole - Frenkel law, being exponential in the square root of the electric field; and a current after the transit time that falls much more slowly than can be accounted for using Gaussian statistics. The same data plotted using log - log axes reveals the behavior over long times and low currents. Before the transit time, the decrease of the current can be characterized by two power laws, but it only decreases by about a factor of 2 from 10 -2 of the transit time to the transit time and is almost independent of electric field from 5 to 80 V/μm. After the transit time the current decreases algebraically as t -1.75 to a current value of about 10 -2 of the value at the transit time and is also almost independent of electric field. Available theoretical models are not consistent with these data. We note a surprising coincidence: the current transients are virtually identical to the current transients obtained in molecular crystals, as if disorder does not play a role in determining the shape of the current transients in molecularly doped polymers. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Applied electric fields; Current transients; Gaussian statistics; Hydrazone; Low currents; Molecularly doped polymers; Poole-Frenkel; Power laws; Square roots; Theoretical models; Transient conductivities; Transit time; Wide dynamic ranges; Electric conductivity measurement; Electric field effects; Electric field measurement; Molecular crystals; Polymers; Tools; Transients; Conducting polymers",,,,,,,19327447,,,"English","J.

Using a convenient sample survey and a series of corporate stories we examine the options for turnaround strategies and the patterns of strategic choice. We find that economic recession provoked the ‘return’ of company owners to the role of ‘internal strategists’ or even into operations management. Under such conditions companies with dispersed ownership have visible disadvantages in building a consistent strategic agenda and timely implementation of robust strategies, as any strategic actions largely depend on a ‘concert’ of corporate strategists. Factor analysis of the actions implemented or planned for implementation reveals two patterns of strategic behaviour – cost leadership and differentiation. Cost leadership is the more popular option as it provides more chances for sustainability in the short term. The selection between the two strategic options is less determined by the company’s past performance and competitiveness than by ambitions of key ‘internal strategists’. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",,,,"Routledge",,,,,14631377,,PCECF,"English","Post-Communist Econ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054044375

However, Russia's climate and soil are mostly not favourable for agriculture and industrial activities, with only 13 per cent of the surface suitable for farming, while the population is concentrated in several regions leaving large areas almost unpopulated. Russian history has also been rather turbulent. After the October Revolution in 1917, the centuries-old tsarist regime was brought to an end. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), comprising 15 such republics, lasted up to 1991. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic dominated the USSR for its entire 74-year history, the USSR often being referred to as ‘Russia’ and its people as ‘Russians’. Russia was the largest republic of the USSR and contributed over half of its population. After the breakup of the USSR in 1991, social and economic reforms were launched. The Soviet ideology, economy and administration underwent a transition towards democratic principles and a free market system.

Our results generalize known results for p = 1, that is, for orthogonal polynomial sequences on the real line that belong to the Blumenthal-Nevai class. As is known, for p ≥ 2, the role of the interval is replaced by a starlike set S of p + 1 rays emanating from the origin on which the Qn satisfy a multiple orthogonality condition involving p measures. Here we obtain strong asymptotics for the Qn in the complex plane outside the common support of these measures as well as on the (finite) open rays of their support. In so doing, we obtain an extension of Weyl's famous theorem dealing with compact perturbations of bounded self-adjoint operators. Furthermore, we derive generalizations of the classical Szego{double acute} functions, and we show that there is an underlying Nikishin system hierarchy for the orthogonality measures that is related to the Weyl functions.

As of 2004 this database recorded 37 million persons at these ages, including 130,000 centenarians (more than double the number in 1990). For men, the probability of surviving from age 80 to age 90 has risen from 12 percent in 1950 to 26 percent in 2002; for women, the increase has been from 16 percent to 38 percent. In the lowest-mortality country, Japan, life expectancy at age 80 in 2006 is estimated to be 6.5 years for men and 11.3 years for women. For selected countries, average annual percent declines in age-specific death rates over the preceding ten years are calculated for single-year age groups 80 to 99 and the years 1970 to 2004. The results are presented in Lexis maps showing the patterns of change in old-age mortality by cohort and period, and separately for men and women. The trends are not favorable in all countries: for example, old-age mortality in the United States has stagnated since 1980. But countries with exceptionally low mortality, like Japan and France, do not show a deceleration in death rate declines. It is argued that life expectancy at advanced ages may continue to increase at the same pace as in the past. © 2008 The Population Council, Inc.",,"aging population; cohort analysis; database; life expectancy; mortality; probability; Asia; Eurasia; Europe; Far East; France; Japan; North America; United States; Western Europe; Lexis",,,,,,,00987921,,,"English","Popul.

The formal education system and the specialized vocational and technical training institutions in particular were poorly prepared to operate under the new market conditions and to supply the new skills that the market required.

Comprehensive and highly prescriptive SHE regulations exist and many of these mirror western standards but they have been developed without consultation with the industries that they regulate. The corporate response, at least amongst the older generation of management, is to either merely comply with or pay lip-service to the law as cheaply as possible. In many cases, they pay the fines for non-compliance. SHE measures are seen as a cost to the business, rather than as an investment to achieve better performance and higher profitability. There is a 'blame culture' that inhibits managers taking any personal responsibility for SHE issues. Accident investigations generally seek to lay the blame on the unfortunate victim, rather than to discover the root-causes and prevent recurrence. Internal shareholder and public pressure for better performance has been, and still is, lacking. This paper gives an anecdotal account of the differing approaches to SHE in the oil and gas industries in the UK and Russian Federation (RF). Accident statistics are compared and cultural differences described. The approach to SHE regulation is examined. Some suggestions for constructive change are made that might help the emerging generation of native young engineers and managers, who are well-trained and cognizant of the need for better SHE performance. © 2008 IChemE.",,"Accidents; Environmental protection; Gas industry; Laws and legislation; Sustainable development; Accident investigations; Anecdotal accounts; Cultural differences; Oil and Gas industries; Oil and Gas sectors; Personal responsibilities; Russian federations; Young engineers; Managers","bp plc;ABB Engineering Services;Burgoyne Consultants Ltd.",,"Hazards XX - Process Safety and Environmental Protection Harnessing Knowledge - Challenging Complacency","14 April 2008 through 17 April 2008","Manchester",74089,03070492,9780852955239,ICESD,"English","Inst Chem Eng Symp Ser",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-56349139146

For this purpose we introduced two absolute power indices extending the classical Penrose (non-normalized Banzhaf) and Coleman (""the power of the body to act"") indices by taking into account the members' preferences to coalesce, based on their membership in the currently functioning political-economic blocs with varying degrees of economic integration and members' regional proximity as well. We considered an indirect voting system where countries are contending for power at two levels: within their constituencies and within the Executive Board. Accordingly, each of the proposed power indices determines a member's power at the appropriate level. The total power of a country is then defined by a compound power index, which is the product of the above-mentioned indices. Experiments displayed the robustness of the indices to small variations in the weight coefficients assigned to the preferences considered. Using our approach, we analysed countries' voting power within the Executive Board under the three cases of majority voting adopted by the IMF, namely, a simple majority and qualified majorities of 70% and 85% of the total votes. The power indices for all members (except those with voting rights suspended) and their constituencies were calculated and compared with the Penrose and Banzhaf indices. The results show that members' absolute voting power as measured by our indices produces a power distribution different from that of Penrose and Banzhaf power in both directions. The constituencies' relative voting power is rather close to their IMF voting weights for the case of the simple majority voting and tends to redistribute between constituencies as the threshold number of votes for a decision to be taken increases; thus, for the 85% supermajority, the maximum power share is that of the Netherlands's constituency and not that of the US's, as the Banzhaf power index suggests. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

I consider a one-shot game between two candidates, where the payoffs of the candidates are their vote shares, and the strategy set of each candidate is a one-dimensional set of policy positions. The utility that a voter attributes to a candidate is linear in both the absolute distance between the candidate's policy position and the voter's preferred policy, and in the electorate's bias toward the candidate (known as the candidate's valence). I assume that the voter decides to abstain if either they are indifferent between the two candidates, or significantly dissatisfied with both candidates; otherwise, the voter votes for the candidate they prefer. I show that under any of the two assumptions about voting behavior, a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium exists under a broad range of conditions, even if the valence of one of the candidates is nonzero. In either case, the candidates do not always choose identical policy positions.

However, the possibility of information sharing influences the bank's incentives in two different ways. While it disciplines the borrowers, and therefore reduces the share of bad loans, a bank loses a competitive advantage, the monopolistic knowledge about the data in its clients' credit histories. Does the bank have an opportunity to use the benefits of information sharing without losing its competitive advantage and its clientele? One way to do so is to report false data on borrowers. In this paper, we analyse the bank's incentives to misreport given the bank cannot refuse to participate in the information sharing system, as membership is obligatory.

In a general equilibrium sticky price model of an open economy we find that the optimal interest rate rule is to respond to all types of shocks in an economy: real exchange rate shocks, supply shocks and demand shocks. We concentrate our analysis on the interest rate defense of the currency. We claim that the extent of the optimal response of the interest rate to exchange rate shocks depends positively on the degree of pass-through and negatively on price rigidity. Therefore, in the presence of asymmetric price rigidity, the optimal monetary policy should be non-linear, and the interest rate should be adjusted more in case of depreciation of the domestic currency than in case of its appreciation by the same magnitude due to higher downward price rigidity and lower downward pass-through, which are observed empirically. We test this prediction for the US economy and find that the US monetary policy is asymmetric indeed with higher reaction of the interest rate to depreciations of US dollar than to appreciations of the same size. © 2007 Society for Policy Modeling.","Asymmetric price rigidity; Exchange rate pass-through effect; Monetary policy; Non-linear interest rate rule",,,,,,,,01618938,,JPMOD,"English","J.

The first source is an overall structure of a scenario, which included communicative actions in addition to attack relations and is learned from previous experience of multi-agent interactions. In our earlier studies we proposed a concept-based learning technique for this source. Scenarios are represented by directed graphs with labeled vertices (for communicative actions) and arcs (for temporal and attack relations). The second source is a traditional machinery to handle argumentative structure of a dialogue, assessing the validity of individual claims. We build a system where data for both sources are visually specified, to assess a validity of customer complaints. Evaluation of contribution of each source shows that both sources of argumentation-related information are essential for assessment of multi-agent scenarios. We conclude that concept learning of scenario structure should be augmented by defeasibility analysis of individual claims to successfully reason about scenario truthfulness. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,"Agents; Flow interactions; Graph theory; Learning algorithms; Argument structuring; Comparative analysis; Concept learning; Concept-based; Conceptual structures; Customer complaints; Defeasibility; Directed graphs; International conferences; Knowledge visualization; Learning techniques; Multi agents; Multi-agent interactions; Two sources; Validity assessment; Multi agent systems",,,"16th International Conference on Conceptual Structures, ICCS 2008","7 July 2008 through 11 July 2008","Toulouse",72913,03029743,3540705953; 9783540705956,,"English","Lect.

Frequent changes in the timing of births and marriages engendered a mass ""abortion culture"". Contraceptive devices of poor quality were produced on a limited scale. The Soviet regime promulgated pronatalism and considered contraception to contradict this ideology. There have been two waves of government policy interventions. In the 1930s and 1940s restrictive and propaganda measures prevailed. These failed to yield serious effects. In the 1980s, policies aimed at lessening the tension between full-time employment and maternal roles. These generated shifts in birth timing, namely shorter birth intervals and earlier second and third births, however increase in completed cohort fertility was minimal. A third wave started in 2007. Preoccupied with continuous depopulation, authorities intend to boost births by substantially increasing benefits. The mid-1990s was a turning point in the change of fertility and nuptiality models. The 1970s birth cohorts marry and become parents later. They delay first and second births and increasingly begin partnerships with cohabitation. Contraception is replacing abortion. New attitudes and perceptions about family, partnership, childbearing, and family planning are emerging. A major transformation typical for developed countries, the Second Demographic Transition, is underway. Nevertheless, many neo-traditional features of fertility and nuptiality remain. These distinguish Russia from most European countries and will persist in the near future. Completed fertility, however, hardly differs from the average European level. © 2008 Zakharov.",,,,,,,,,14359871,,,"English","Demogr. Res.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-46849116577

There also exist the classic ""full-run"" and ""no-run"" equilibria in which there is no project evaluation. Investors' coordination on a specific equilibrium is triggered by a self-fulfilling prophecy.

In these theories, energetic disorder determines the energy width of the hopping site manifold. It is generally assumed that the disorder-created energy width arises from interactions between the charge on a dopant molecule and its environment, including the dipole moments of neighboring dopant molecules, the dipole moments of the molecules of the polymer matrix, and van der Waals interactions with neighboring molecules. This assumption can be tested experimentally. Bassler's formulation of the Gaussian Disorder Model predicts that the energy width can be obtained from the temperature dependence of the mobility: it appears as an activation energy. A review of experimentally characterized MDP systems reveals that there is almost no experimental evidence to support the prediction that the experimentally observed activation energy is due to energetic disorder. Instead, the data appear to suggest that the activation energy is primarily intramolecular in origin. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"ABS resins; Chemical activation; Electric dipole moments; Flow interactions; Molecules; Polymers; Van der Waals forces; Charge transporting; Dopant molecules; Energy width; Experimental evidence; Gaussian disorder model; Molecularly doped polymers; Neighboring molecules; Temperature dependences; Van der Waals interactions; Activation energy",,,,,,,19327447,,,"English","J.

However, many of these guidelines are not supported by evidence and, despite their existence, there is considerable unexplained variation in practice. This study examines the decision to recommend a Caesarean section, an intervention for which there is a solid evidence base, but whose use varies considerably among facilities in Russia. Aim: To identify the factors that Russian obstetricians take into account when recommending a Caesarean section. Methods: Conjoint analysis. Ninety-two obstetricians from three regions were asked to state whether they would recommend a Caesarean section in each of 30 vignettes (including three for validation) combining 10 medical, social and organizational factors previously identified as contributing to the decision to intervene, including some absolute indications to intervene or not to, on the basis of international evidence. Results: Checks for consistency within ratings by individuals gave no cause for concern. However, there was a wide variation in the probability of intervening among obstetricians, with six recommending intervention in only one scenario and one in 27 scenarios. Some factors were consistent with evidence but others were not, such as myopia or previous abortions. Intervention was more likely at 11 p.m. than at noon. Male obstetricians were more likely to intervene than females. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of understanding clinical decision-making in Russia as a prelude to changing it. © The Author 2007.

The purpose of the paper is to propose a constructive way of developing a semantic networking language (SNL) of a new generation and, as a consequence, to bridge a gap between UNL-based studies and Semantic Web projects. Design/methodology/approach – The methodological basis of the paper is a new theory of designing semantic-syntactic analyzers of NL texts elaborated by the author of the paper and called the theory of K-representations (knowledge representations). One of its basic components is a mathematical model describing a system of ten partial operations on conceptual structures and determining a new class of formal languages called restricted standard knowledge languages (RSK-languages). Findings – It is shown that the expressive possibilities of RSK-languages surpass the expressive possibilities of UNL from the standpoint of representing the meanings of discourses, compound goals, descriptions of sets, definitions of notions. It is proposed to use the definition of the class of RSK-languages as a model of a SNL of a new generation in comparison with UNL. Practical implications – It is also proposed to use the definition of RSK-languages for building semantic annotations of arbitrary web-documents and web-services.

In this meaning, the proposed theory can be called ""essentially multiparametric"". It is developed on the basis of the Kolmogorov asymptotic approach in which sample size increases along with the number of unknown parameters. This theory opens a way for solution of central problems of multivariate statistics, which up until now have not been solved. Traditional statistical methods based on the idea of an infinite sampling often break down in the solution of real problems, and, dependent on data, can be inefficient, unstable and even not applicable. In this situation, practical statisticians are forced to use various heuristic methods in the hope the will find a satisfactory solution. Mathematical theory developed in this book presents a regular technique for implementing new, more efficient versions of statistical procedures. Near exact solutions are constructed for a number of concrete multi-dimensional problems: estimation of expectation vectors, regression and discriminant analysis, and for the solution to large systems of empiric linear algebraic equations. It is remarkable that these solutions prove to be not only non-degenerating and always stable, but also near exact within a wide class of populations. In the conventional situation of small dimension and large sample size these new solutions far surpass the classical, commonly used consistent ones. It can be expected in the near future, for the most part, traditional multivariate statistical software will be replaced by the always reliable and more efficient versions of statistical procedures implemented by the technology described in this book. This monograph will be of interest to a variety of specialists working with the theory of statistical methods and its applications. Mathematicians would find new classes of urgent problems to be solved in their own regions. Specialists in applied statistics creating statistical packages will be interested in more efficient methods proposed in the book. Advantages of these methods are obvious: the user is liberated from the permanent uncertainty of possible instability and inefficiency and gets algorithms with unimprovable accuracy and guaranteed for a wide class of distributions. A large community of specialists applying statistical methods to real data will find a number of always stable highly accurate versions of algorithms that will help them to better solve their scientific or economic problems. Students and postgraduates will be interested in this book as it will help them get at the foremost frontier of modern statistical science. - Presents original mathematical investigations and open a new branch of mathematical statistics - Illustrates a technique for developing always stable and efficient versions of multivariate statistical analysis for large-dimensional problems - Describes the most popular methods some near exact solutions; including algorithms of non-degenerating large-dimensional discriminant and regression analysis. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Two types of surface deformations correspond to trapping and transistor types of dynamics. We observe the ""negative mass"" effect in the low-energy spectrum under trapping deformations. We also compute, in geometrical terms, the energy levels near the spectral bottom (these levels are below the minimal Landau level).

Rapid advances in virtual interface and computer technologies over the past decade have afforded the development of multi-sensory, immersive, and interactive virtual environments, which employ a variety of display and control interfaces. These include, but are not limited to, combinations of helmet-mounted displays, 3-D auditory displays, haptic and force feedback interfaces, vestibular displays, head and eye position tracking devices, manual controllers, voice and gesture recognition technology, and brain-body actuated controllers. Despite these technological advances, numerous and significant challenges still exist for the effective design of human-machine interfaces in virtual environments. Aerospace establishments and agencies across the globe have long been exploiters of virtual environment technology (or ""synthetic environments""), primarily in large-scale simulators designed for such activities as telerobotics or teleoperation (of remotely operated vehicles) and telepresence (at the remote or hazardous or imaginary site), scientific data visualization and exploration (e.g., CFD data visualization), and of course tri-service pilot, navigator and maintenance personnel training. Currently, VR has been developed to create realistic technical environments for such tasks as helicopter machine gun training, parachuting experience, naval helicopter deck landing and many more. Also, as aerospace hardware becomes more advanced, the inevitable reduction in real systems available for training means that computer-based lessons, many featuring VR, will become an essential tool of the aerospace class room, helping to familiarize tri-service personnel with the spatial and behavioral aspects of aerospace platforms subsystems. This paper presents some preliminary findings of testing some virtual reality applications to aerospace and seeks to define those issues demanding urgent consideration.",,"Auditory displays; Control interfaces; Real time simulation; Virtual environment technology; Flight simulators; Haptic interfaces; Helmet mounted displays; Human computer interaction; Large scale systems; Speech recognition; Virtual reality; Aerospace engineering",,,"45th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting 2007","8 January 2007 through 11 January 2007","Reno, NV",69861,,1563478900; 9781563478901,,"English","Collect.

It is assumed that the judgements regarding the preference superiority of one object over another are given in the forms of intervals, that is by indicating the lower and upper bounds. The suggested approach is suitable both in the case of consistent and inconsistent preferences. In the former case, the available intervals are processed by contracting them to the maximum degree, in the latter, by extending them to the minimum degree. The degrees of contraction or extension are regarded as the indexes of indeterminacy or inconsistency of preferences, and treated as multiple objective functions.

A steady-state value is still attained; however, its increase relative to the case of unipolar conductivity is disproportionately high with respect to a relatively small value of the parameter χ, which characterizes the relative contribution of minority carriers to the current.

The method provides an opportunity to explore the Pareto frontier, that is, the criterion tradeoffs, for three and more criteria. The knowledge about criterion tradeoffs helps stakeholders to better understand the problem, specify the preferred combination of the criterion values (the goal), and compute the associated decision alternatives. The method is introduced on the basis of an example related to coastal water pollution. Then, real-life applications of the method are described in short. Possible applications of this method in the case of risk and uncertainty are discussed.

The main actors in this system are the so-called 'clans' including business people affiliated with state officials and sometimes with criminal groups. In the analysis of the context of the Russian transformation a detailed study deals with the internal structure of a clan, focusing on its five main constituents (leader or 'chieftain', 'core', skilled professionals, ordinary members, agents of influence). Within clan capitalism, mechanisms of clan coordination dominate, while market mechanism and bureaucratic coordination are relatively weaker. The main features of this system are a clan-state, providing the convertibility of resources that maintain favourable conditions for clan activities; post-Soviet monopolism that is basically of a non-market character; distortion of the aims of enterprise; institutionalisation of the shadow economy; and unprotected property rights. Now clan capitalism has turned to the stage of oligarch capitalism with Putin's clan as the core of new Russian oligarchy. © 2007 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.","Clan; Clan capitalism; Informal networks; Russia","bureaucracy; capitalism; informal sector; market transition; monopoly; oligopoly; political economy; Eurasia; Russian Federation",,,,,,,00016373,,,"English","Acta Oecon.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34347257420

The analysis is focused on three major dimensions of the Chinese energy strategy: security of supply, competitiveness and environmental protection. The security of supply dimension is characterized by a decrease of import strategy from a dependency on Gulf countries to favor regional projects for import of oil and gas from Russia and Central Asia.

The infinite random word η = η1η2 ... ηn ... takes values in the Fibonacci compactum and determines the so-called Erdos measure μ(A) = P(η A) on it. The invariant Erdos measure is the shift-invariant measure with respect to which the Erdos measure is absolutely continuous. We show that the Erdos measures are sofic. Recall that a sofic system is a symbolic system that is a continuous factor of a topological Markov chain. A sofic measure is a one-block (or symbol-to-symbol) factor of the measure corresponding to a homogeneous Markov chain. For the Erdos measures, the corresponding regular Markov chain has 5 states. This gives ergodic properties of the invariant Erdos measure. We give a new ergodic theory proof of the singularity of the distribution of the random variable ζ. Our method is also applicable when ξ1, ξ2, ... is a stationary Markov chain with values 0, 1. In particular, we prove that the distribution of ζ is singular and that the Erdos measures appear as the result of gluing together states in a regular Markov chain with 7 states.

The paper outlines a possible structure of Cognitonics and describes its formal tool. It is the notation of conceptual-visual dynamic schemes (CVD-schemes) - an extension of the notation of semantic nets, being popular in the artificial intelligence theory. A general approach to the use of CVD-schemes for inventing effective analogies in order to introduce difficult pieces of studied theoretical materials is illustrated. The optimal preconditions of successful introducing young children to computers are formulated as a consequence of discovering by the authors of a possible way of achieving in teaching the goals of Cognitonics. With this aim, the concept of the 'Thought-Producing Self' of the child is defined. The paper describes a scheme of the proposed method of the harmonic humanitarian development of the child allowing for realizing the 'Thought-Producing Self' of each normal, average child by the age of seven - nine, where the starting age is five to six years. The method has been personally tested by one of the authors during 16 years, the total number of successfully taught young children and teenagers exceeds four hundred.

The author analyses several ways in which companies realise these strategies, drawing analogies with the 'exit' and 'voice' strategies suggested by A. Hirschman. It is shown that under the conditions of a weak state these strategies lead either to an expansion of the shadow economy or to 'state capture'. Both the privatisation of the state and the lack of its privatisation result in budget crises as well as drastic social and political shocks, leading to calls for a 'strong hand' in the business community itself. However, as there is little political competition and the mechanisms of democratic control are weak, state consolidation takes place as a bureaucratic consolidation accompanied by new opportunities for informal 'business capture' by the authorities. Nevertheless, the high degree of openness of the economy and the remaining heterogeneity of political actors provide business with a wide range of possible strategies of interaction with the state. This article explores how these strategies are becoming more formal and public compared to the 1990s. Strategies of isolation from the state now take place as legal strategies of internationalisation. Cooperation strategies, on the other hand, currently seem to be more efficient when switching from the traditional lobbying of private interests to more rational and collective actions aimed at providing the necessary conditions for sustainable economic development.",,"business development; economic development; globalization; privatization; strategic approach; sustainable development; Eurasia; Russian Federation",,,,,,,09668136,,,"English","Eur.

In our experiments, we used commercially made test MOS capacitors based on thermal silicon dioxide film with thickness in the range from 7 to 100 nm. Using the proposed multilevel current stress technique one can investigate the positive charge generation in MOS structure gate dioxide under high electric fields. The technique is different from the standard constant current stress technique, as it includes two levels of current: the stress current level, which provides the generation of positive charge, and the additional measuring current level, which allows to monitor the change of dielectric charge. Due to the additional measuring current level, it is possible to decrease significantly the error of positive charge density measurement in the dielectric. The latter error is caused by the positive charge trapped in the initial stage of electron injection while the steady-state of the stress mode is being reached. It was found that the rise of sample temperature leads to a decrease of the density of the positive charge generated in SiO2 film under high-field injection of electrons from the silicon substrate. A model of the positive charge generation in MOS structures under high-field electron injection has been proposed. The new model of the positive charge generation in MOS structures takes into account the temperature effect and the subsequent phenomena of dielectric charge state change: the band-to-band impact ionization in SiO2 with the creation of electron-hole pairs and the subsequent trapping of holes in traps in the oxide; the trapping of injected electrons by trapped holes as well as the thermal release of trapped holes from the traps. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

These problems are solved using computer simulation. Creating a complex 3-dimensional mathematical model for this simulation is not always justified as it leads to a significant labor cost resulting from both data preparation and subsequent calculations. In order to obtain the essential estimates for the above-mentioned technological processes and for the optimization of pressure and temperature parameters, it is more practical to use simplified 2.5D models. This allows analyzing significantly larger number of feasible parameter sets in search for the optimal solution. It turns out that in many cases these estimates are practically acceptable except for extremely complex die patterns. For the most critical parts, after getting an initial estimate solution, one can carry out additional calculations utilizing a full 3D model. This approach reduces to a minimum the number of prototypes of forming trials.

This idea leads to a family of systems of ordinary differential equations, called Hamilton-Ehrenfest M-systems (M ≤ 0, 1, 2, ...). As noted in the authors' previous works, every M-system is formally equivalent to the semiclassical approximation of order M for the linear Schrödinger equation. In this paper a similar approach is undertaken for a nonlinear Hartree-type equation with a smooth integral kernel. It is demonstrated how quantum characteristics can be retrieved directly from the corresponding Hamilton-Ehrenfest systems, without solving the quantum equation: the semiclassical spectral series are obtained from the rest point solution.

From the idea that all these problems can be treated as problems with an operator-valued symbol, a general regular scheme of adiabatic approximation based on operator methods is proposed. This scheme is a generalization of the Born-Oppenheimer and Maslov methods, the Peierls substitution, etc. The approach proposed in this paper allows one to obtain ""effective"" reduced equations for a wide class of states inside terms (i.e., inside modes, subbands of dimensional quantization, etc.) with possible degeneration taken into account. Next, by application of asymptotic methods, in particular the semiclassical approximation method, to the reduced equation, the states corresponding to a distinguished term (effective Hamiltonian) can be classified. It is shown that the adiabatic effective Hamiltonian and the semiclassical Hamiltonian can be different, which results in the appearance of ""nonstandard characteristics"" while passing to classical mechanics. This approach is used to construct solutions of several problems in wave and quantum mechanics, particularly problems in molecular physics, solid-state physics, nanophysics and hydrodynamics. © Springer 2006.","Adiabatic and semiclassical approximation; Born-Oppenheimer method; Electron-phonon interaction; Interval waves; Maslov operator methods; Nanofilms; Picnocline","Approximation theory; Asymptotic stability; Continuum mechanics; Electrons; Hamiltonians; Mathematical operators; Phonons; Adiabatic approximation; Born-Oppenheimer method; Interval waves; Maslov operator method; Nanofilms; Picnocline; Semiclassical approximation; Quantum theory; Approximation theory; Asymptotic stability; Continuum mechanics; Electrons; Hamiltonians; Mathematical operators; Phonons; Quantum theory",,,,,,,00220833,,,"English","J.

It is felt that the TOF method taken alone is incapable of resolving the standing dilemma. As a final means to resolve it, we propose a combination of two varieties of the TOF technique using both sheet-like and uniform carrier generation modes in conjunction with radiation-induced conductivity measurements. All three techniques are realized using the ELA-50 electron gun facility. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach we report experimental data for PVK, which show that carrier transport in this polymer is indeed dispersive.

It is shown against Russian historical background, that the absolutist state in this country could never be identified with the society and these relations were shaped under its strong domination. The ethics of rule-following characteristic for market economy in general did not develop in Russia. The breakdown of communist Russia and market reforms proceeding since 1992 did not change this situation significantly. The period of political alliance between big business and government was followed by restoration of state dominance in somewhat modified forms. Both periods were characterized by corruption, which contrary to Putin's slogans, increases in Russia. In the article I show the evolution of Putin administration's policy which changed from emphasizing and improving legal institutions to selective use of legal norms depending on personal loyalty. Main forms of state exploitation of Russian business are described. The conclusion is that Russian experience of balancing state and market should be called negative. © Springer 2006.","Ethics of rule-following; Transition economies",,,,,,,,01674544,,,"English","J.

Quantization, for systems over a noncompact Riemannian configuration manifold, may be achieved by the introduction of a magneto-metric analog of the Stratonovich quantizer a family of invertible, selfadjoint operators representing quantum δ functions. Based on the quantizer, we construct a generalized Wigner transform that maps Hilbert-Schmidt operators into L2 phase-space functions. The algebraic properties of the quantizer allow one to extract a family of symplectic reflections, which are then used to (i) derive a simple, explicit, and geometrically invariant formula for the noncommutative product of functions on phase space, and (ii) construct a magneto-metric connection on phase space. The classical limit of this product is given by the usual multiplication of functions (zeroth-order term), the magnetic Poisson bracket (first-order term), and by the magneto-metric connection (second-order term). © 2006 NRC Canada.",,"Functions; Magnetic fields; Mathematical operators; Mathematical transformations; Quantum theory; Magnetic Poisson bracket; Magnetic quantization; Riemannian manifolds; Symplectic reflections; High energy physics",,,,,,,00084204,,CJPHA,"English","Can J Phys",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845754785

The interaction of hydrogen at molecular, atomic and ionizated states with niobium was under experimental research. The maximum value of low-temperature steady state permeation efficiency (SPE) was observed at Ar plasma cleaned inlet surface and with insignificant influence of outlet surface conditions. Such result is unusual and contradicts the developed classical representations and other published data for high-temperature range plasma-driven permeation. We explain this phenomenon by influence of defect structure of the polycrystalline membrane. The defects lead to the enhanced diffusion of hydrogen atoms along the crystallite sides. Such diffusion can essentially increase SPE of hydrogen through metal at low temperatures. The validity of this explanation was proved by the comparison of molecular hydrogen sorption & desorption measurements in poly- and mono-crystal Nb samples. The weighing method was used in that case. The phase transition β′→α in the Nb-H system is important for an explanation of SPE temperature dependencies in low-temperature range. The defects initiate phase transitions. The short-time enhanced hydrogen permeation was observed after irradiation of a membrane surface by Ar ions. The surface dissociation of the molecular ions, excited molecules and partially ordinary unexcited molecules of hydrogen can explain these observations. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.","Hydrogen; Plasma driven permeation",,,,"HYDROGEN IN MATTER: A Collection from the Papers Presented at the 2nd International Symposium on Hydrogen in Matter,ISOHIM","13 June 2005 through 17 June 2005","Uppsala",,0094243X,0735403295; 9780735403291,,"English","AIP Conf.

As a result, in 1999–2005 the Russian economy grew by 57 per cent. In spite of the fact that the rate of growth slowed in mid-2004 and early 2005, largely due to a negative change in economic policy, growth numbers remained relatively strong (if not as high as they could be). So, Russia continues to demonstrate a healthier macroeconomic performance than many other countries. Equally important, is the fact that Russia financed this growth mainly from its own sources, i.e., without any massive inflow of FDI or external borrowing (albeit the latter did increase substantially in 2003 and has kept growing since then). Russia for decades was a country that exported capital. Capital flight was not a phenomenon only of the 1990s. It also took place in earlier decades, although for different reasons and through different channels. From the macroeconomic point of view, continuous support of communist regimes all over the world can be treated as capital flight legitimized by the government. It also means that once Russia starts attracting more FDI, which will finance particular projects, growth rates may be high even in the absence of domestic financing. That said, the well-known task of doubling the GDP in 10 years, as was suggested by the Russian president in 2003, in principle looks achievable. © individual contributors 2006.",,,,"Anthem Press",,,,,,9781843317555; 9781843312178,,"English","Russia's Oil and Natural Gas: Bonanza or Curse?",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905539608

For commutative polynomial rings, this property has been established by Hermann in 1926. We establish the same property for several classes of noncommutative algebras, including the most common class of rings in noncommutative projective geometry, that is, strongly Noetherian rings, which includes Noetherian PI algebras and Sklyanin algebras. We extensively study so-called universally coherent algebras, that is, such that the function D(d) is bounded by 2d for d ≫ 0. For example, finitely presented monomial algebras belong to this class, as well as many algebras with finite Groebner basis of relations. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc.","Coherent ring; Graded ring; Hilbert series; Koszul filtration; Linear equation; Strongly Noetherian algebra",,,,,,,,00218693,,JALGA,"English","J.

Experimental laboratory studies of the mechanical properties of the material show that one can lower the temperature of industrial superplastic forming. A developed mathematical model is proposed and enables to calculate an optimum pressurization taking into account the structural state of the shell material and principles of the shell friction on the die surface. The calculated pressurization enables to obtain the optimum superplastic properties of the material in the maximum area of the deformed shell. The proposed model has been checked up experimentally. In laboratory conditions, the forming of special workpieces with calculated pressurization has been conducted. The experimental researches confirm the made theoretical forecasts about a capability of decreasing the forming temperature of SPF VT6 alloy components.

The combined models are defined as the sums of uncertain bounded deterministic functions and stochastic white noises. However the corresponding variational problem turns out to be very difficult for direct solution. Therefore simplified filtering algorithms are developed. The levels of nonoptimality for these simplified algorithms are introduced. in opposite to the original variational problem, these levels can be easily evaluated numerically. Thus simple filtering algorithms with guaranteed performance are obtained. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of our approach.

It was shown that although radiation conductivity in PS is mainly due to free charge carriers, the allowance for a long duration of the field-assisted thermal dissociation of geminate pairs is absolutely necessary for understanding the revealed features of current transients and the relevant voltage-current curve. The observation of unimolecular trapping in the dispersive transport mode is strongly complicated even in doped PS, not to mention the irradiated polymer.

The definition of SK-languages is a part of a mathematical model describing a system consisting of such 10 operations on structured meanings (SMs) of natural language texts (NL-texts) that, using primitive conceptual items as ""blocks"", it is possible to build SMs of, probably, arbitrary NL-texts. This means that a class of languages is determined being convenient for building semantic descriptions of arbitrary goods, services, and contracts. The principal advantages of SK-languages in comparison with first-order logic, Discourse Representation Theory, Theory of Conceptual Graphs, and Episodic Logic concern representing complicated goals and destinations of things, definitions of concepts, compound definitions of sets, and meanings of discourses with the references to the meaning of a phrase or larger part of discourse. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",,"Computer programming languages; Contracts; Graph theory; Intelligent agents; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Text processing; Building contracts; E-negotiations; Flexible tools; Structured meanings (SM); Electronic commerce",,,"6th International Conference on E-Commerce and Web Technologies, EC-Web 2005","23 August 2005 through 26 August 2005","Copenhagen",65812,03029743,,,"English","Lect.

If f ∈ X T and n is a positive integer, we set ν(n,f) = sup ∑ i=1 n d(f(b i), f(a i)), where the supremum is taken over all numbers a 1,..., a n, b 1,...,b n from T such that a 1 ≤ b 1 ≤ a 2 ≤ b 2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ a n ≤ b n. The sequence {ν(n, f)} n=1 ∞ is called the modulus of variation of f in the sense of Chanturiya. We prove the following pointwise selection principle: If a sequence of functions {f j} j=1 ∞ ⊂ X T is such that the closure in X of the set {f j(t)} j=1 ∞ is compact for each t ∈ T and lim n→∞ (1/n lim j→∞ sup ν (n, f j)) = 0, (*) then there exists a subsequence of {f j} j=1 ∞, which converges in X pointwise on T to a function f ∈ X T satisfying lim n→∞ ν (n,f)/n = 0. We show that condition (*) is optimal (the best possible) and that all known pointwise selection theorems follow from this result (including Helly's theorem). Also, we establish several variants of the above theorem for the almost everywhere convergence and weak pointwise convergence when X is a reflexive separable Banach space. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Studies of radiation-induced conductivity (conductivity proper as well as transit effects) uniquely prove the dispersive rather than the Gaussian transport of holes (majority carriers) in this polymer.

The averaged Hamiltonian in this cluster is expressed in terms of generators of some dynamical algebra with polynomial commutation relations; the structure of these relations is determined by a pair of coprime integers contained in the resonance ratio. We construct the irreducible hypergeometric representations of this algebra. The averaged spectral problem in the irreducible representation is reduced to a second-or third-order ordinary differential equation whose solutions are model polynomials. The asymptotic behavior of the solution of the original problem concerning the Zeeman-Stark effect in the resonance cluster is constructed using the coherent states of the dynamical algebra.

Special attention is paid to the causes of dramatic discrepancies between the expected outputs of institutional reforms implemented by the Russian government with World Bank and IMF support and the actual behaviour of Russian companies. Why was the model of interaction between enterprises and investors, owners and managers, which had been successful in other countries, rejected by Russian business in the 1990s? And how can we evaluate certain positive changes that have occurred recently in corporate policies of major Russian companies? These questions are answered on the bases of analysis of economic agents' motivation at different stages of development of corporate structures in Russia. The article argues that the need for comprehensive organisational and technological restructuring of enterprises led to the need for a concentrated ownership structure. The formation of such a structure in the late 1990s (which occurred, in fact, contrary to the government's activities) created preconditions for extending the time horizon of dominant owners and managers and for positive qualitative changes in the relations between major Russian companies and their shareholders and investors. © 2004 Centre for Research into Post-Communist Economies.",,"corporate strategy; industrial policy; ownership; strategic approach; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Russian Federation; World",,,,,,,14631377,,PCECF,"English","Post-Communist Econ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-11344286569

Russian CEOs see the necessity of profound changes in many areas of enterprise management and are not afraid of such changes, as innovations are perceived to be the best competitive weapon. However, their resources for radical innovation are rather limited. Beside lack of finance, the superimposed narrower strategic focus, the rigidities of local business networks, the weakness of external infrastructure for innovation and the absence of state support seriously impede attempts to implement radical changes. However, in every Russian industry surveyed there is a visible presence of innovative companies, which constitute 15-30% of all large and medium-size companies. Moreover, increasing imports and the growing number of foreign subsidiaries in Russia will continue to push Russian companies towards more intensive changes in all areas of enterprise management. © 2004 Centre for Research into Post-Communist Economies.",,"corporate strategy; innovation; science and technology; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Russian Federation; World",,,,,,,14631377,,PCECF,"English","Post-Communist Econ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-11344263619

One of such promising technique is the optical multi-wave diffusion and absorption spectrophotometry. It allows a doctor to measure a number of important medical and biological (M&B) parameters such as the blood microcirculation parameters into the soft tissues, contents of the hemoglobin fractions into the periphery blood, etc. The use of the new components of the microelectronics and optics and development of new approaches to the diagnostic data processing makes it possible to design a of number of small and effective devices for this purpose. The basic principle of work of them in means of hardware function is the multi-wave light scanning of the tested tissue's area and detecting a backscattered light. In means of software function the basic principle of work of them is the inverse optical task solution when the optical and corresponding M&B parameters of the tested medium are calculated from the measured backscattered spectral optical data. This report presents one of such designed portable apparatus ""Spectrotest""® developed in cooperation with Moscow Regional Research and Clinical Institute of ""MONIKI"". This device allows a doctor to register the index of melanin pigmentation of the skin, the volume of the blood in the tested tissue and the average hemoglobin saturation of the peripheral blood. All this parameters are available for a doctor to see them on the monitor screen in real-time mode directly during any diagnostic or treatment procedure. For that a new modified light scattering theory with the analytical solution of the main equations has been developed. Analytical solution allows the software to calculate and indicate the measured M&B parameters on the computer's monitor screen during less than one second. Today the developed diagnostic system ""Spectrotest""® is used in real clinical practice in ""MONIKI"" and in the Oncology Center of the Russian Academy of Medical Science for the medical research aims. The general hardware and software composites of this diagnostic apparatus and examples of the application of it for the functional diagnostic tests are presented in this report as well.","Blood; Diagnostics; Fractions of the hemoglobin; Microcirculation; Noninvasive; Spectroscopy","Absorption spectroscopy; Blood; Diagnosis; Microcirculation; Microelectronics; Noninvasive medical procedures; Parameter estimation; Tissue; Fractions of the homoglobin; Light scanning; Noninvasive; Soft tissues; Spectrophotometry","SPIE Russia Chapter;CRDF- U.S. CRDF for the Indep.

The unified investigation method practiced in this work, which is based on the combination of the above approaches, makes it possible to unequivocally determine both the transport type and the parameters of a corresponding physical-mathematical model.

The theory also allowed to solve the problem of excitation of slow-wave systems and simulate devices including areas near cut-off frequencies without using any equivalent circuits taking into account the dynamic effects of the space charge.",,"Computer programming; Computer simulation; Electric excitation; Electromagnetic field effects; Electron beams; Harmonic analysis; Maxwell equations; Microwave devices; Phase shift; Electrodynamic theory; Electromagnetic field excitation; Monographs; Periodic waveguides; Waveguides","IEEE Electron Devices Society, EDS",,"5Th IEEE International Vacuum Electronics Conference, IVEC 2004","27 April 2004 through 29 April 2004","Monterey, CA",63428,,0780382617,,"English","Int.

Selection theorems are obtained by virtue of a single compactness argument, which is the exact generalization of the Helly selection principle. For set-valued mappings with the above properties we obtain a Castaing-type representation and prove the existence of multivalued selections and selections which pass through the boundaries of the images of the set-valued mapping and which are nearest in variation to a given mapping. Multivalued Lipschitzian superposition operators acting on mappings of bounded generalized variation are characterized, and solutions of bounded generalized variation to functional inclusions and embeddings, including variable set-valued operators in the right hand side, are obtained. © Heldermann Verlag.","Generalized variation; Multivalued superposition operators; Regular selections; Selection principle; Set-valued mappings",,,,,,,,14256908,,,"English","J.

In this dynamical geometry one can translate nonanalytic functions and distributions rather than tangent vectors. We describe the dynamical holonomy and the dynamical curvature. At the symplectic or quantum level, this construction makes up the symplectic or quantum paths, as well quantum connection, quantum curvature, and quantum holonomy. The construction of path-diffeomorphisms, when applied to trajectories of a given dynamical system, produces a dynamical localization of the system.

The latter is valid under all experimental situations upon classical and quantum systems. We discuss also the quantum measurement situation that is similar to the classical one, described by the Bayes formula. We show the compatibility of the description of this quantum measurement situation in the frame of purely classical and experimentally justified straightforward frequency arguments and in the frame of the quantum stochastic approach to the description of generalized quantum measurements. In view of derived results, we argue that even under experiments upon classical systems the classical Bayes formula describes particular experimental situations that are specific for context-independent measurements. The similarity of the forms of the relation between the transformation of probabilities, which we derive in the frame of the quantum stochastic approach and in the frame of the approach, based on straightforward frequency arguments, underlines once more that the projective (von Neumann) measurements represent only a special type of measurement situations in quantum physics.","Bayes's formula; Interference of probabilities; Quantum probabilistic rule",,,,,,,,00159018,,,"English","Found.

The experiments were made on 4kJ Plasma Focus installation. Such type of installations is capable to form pulse of axial plasma flows moving with velocity approximately 108 cm/s and plasma density is about 1018 cm3. Pure vanadium was chosen in our researches, because it can be used as a basic element at the creation of low-activated alloys. We found that due to a pulse irradiation of vanadium by deuterium plasma, shock waves arises, which result in super-deep penetration of deuterium into a volume of the studied sample. This process is accompanied with the change of vanadium structure, the occurrence of pores in it, and changes of its mechanical properties. The break-away of vanadium particles from the backside surface of the sample and forming of craters were also observed.","Material science; Plasma focus; Superdeep penetration of deuterium",,,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",,,,,00114626,,,"English","Czech.

Given that many systems are often subject to component failures or repairs, changing subsystem interconnections and abrupt environmental disturbances etc., the structure and parameters of underlying NSDDEs may change abruptly. One way to model such abrupt changes is to use the continuous-time Markov chains. As a result, the underlying NSDDEs become NSDDEs with Markovian switching which are hybrid systems. So far little is known about the NSDDEs with Markovian switching and the aim of this paper is to close this gap. In this paper we will not only establish a fundamental theory for such systems but also discuss some important properties of the solutions e.g. boundedness and stability.","Brownian motion; Generalized Itô's formula; Hybrid system; Markov chain",,,,,,,,07362994,,,"English","Stoch.

The idea is that usual Web-sites are created to inform the users, to display the treasures, to show the gems of the collections in order to attract the attention of the audience. The way information is provided is based on the expected background of the possible users and on possible motivation. In case of children, everything is different: information acquisition is to be based on strong interest. It means that the child should be struck by the vision, then be emotionally touched and have enough time for establishing links between the images already existing in his/her conceptual picture of the world and new, just found images. In respond, the child will positively or negatively react to the acquired piece of information and inscribe his/her interpretation of the new found vision into his/her conceptual system, including his/her estimation of the vision.

Thus the well-known result of Khelemskii (claiming that, for a von Neumann algebra, Connes-amenability is equivalent to the condition that the predual bimodule is injective) cannot be extended to measure algebras. Moreover, for a discrete amenable group, we give a simple formula for a normal virtual diagonal of the measure algebra.

For fixed p &gt; 0 and q &gt; 0 one considers the differential expressions sp+[f](x) = (-1) n(xp a(x)f(n))(n)(x), s q-[f](x) = (-1)n((-x)qb(x)f (n))(n)(x) of arbitrary even order 2n degenerate at the point x = 0. Let Hp+ and Hq- be the minimal symmetric operators induced by sp+[f](x) and sq-[f](x) in the Hilbert spaces L2(0, h) and L2(-h, 0), respectively. 'Sewing together' the differential expressions sp+[f](x) and sq-[f](x) at x = 0 one obtains a new differential expression spq[f](x), x ∈ [-h, h], which is degenerate at the same point, an interior point of [-h, h]. Under certain constraints on p and q the differential expression s pq[f](x) gives rise to a minimal symmetric operator Hpq in L2 (-h, h) which is a symmetric extension of the orthogonal sum Hq- ⊕ Hp+. The point x = 0 is called in this paper an interior barrier for spq[f](x). Conditions ensuring the equality HPq = Hq ⊕ Hp are found. It is natural to call an interior barrier an impenetrable interior interface if this equality holds and it is a penetrable interior interface if it fails.

It has been found that injection treatment of MOS structures with thermal SiO2 film allows control of the statistical distribution of charge defects, and thus the mean charge injected into the dielectric to breakdown is increased.

We also examine the correlation between Early State political development and ruler sacralization. Though this correlation is insignificant for the whole sample, its insignificance is accounted for by two distinct evolutionary patterns. The pattern observed in the ""axial age"" zone is characterized by a strong negative correlation between political development and ruler sacralization, while the pattern observed throughout the rest of the world is characterized by a strong positive correlation between the two variables.

This allows us to construct new solutions for a chosen class of dissipative equations. This algorithm is similar to the method of ""dressing"" the solutions of integrable equations. The equations thus obtained imply a ""compatibility "" condition and resemble a nonlinear Lax pair with variable coefficients. So we propose a method for constructing such pairs. To construct solutions of a more complicated form, we propose to use the ""property of zero denominators and factorized brackets,"" which has been discovered experimentally. The expressions thus constructed are said to be ""hidden quasi-invariant."" They allow us to find true relations between the functions contained in the ansatz, to correct the ansatz, and to construct a solution. We present some examples of new solutions constructed following this approach. Such solutions can be used for majorizing in comparison theorems and for modeling phase processes and process in neurocomputers. A program for computing solutions by methods of computer algebra is written. These techniques supplement the classical methods for constructing solutions by using their group properties. In the paper we prove the new precise singular solutions of a model of shallow-water equations exist. It is given at the end of the paper.

Recent experiments employing both techniques simultaneously resulted in conflicting conclusions about charge carrier transport in molecularly doped polymers. Whereas the latter method gives a consistent representation of it as a highly non-equilibrium phenomenon of yet unspecified duration (dispersive process), the former is notorious for a number of ambiguous results, some of which are still present, and it is also known to generate the Gaussian disorder model predicting the prevalent steady-state mobility (Gaussian transport). A way to reconcile these seemingly contradictory data has been suggested. This consists of taking due account of surface effects arising from the presence of surface regions (layers) in the dielectric sample with somewhat inferior electronic properties compared with the bulk. Preliminary calculations lend credit to this idea. It is argued that the time-of-flight method should be supplemented by some bulk excitation technique, which allows us to minimize or even remove surface effects. The methodological basis of the former method should be revisited. On the weight of the available information, preference should be given to the dispersive rather than the Gaussian transport but a major problem still exists.","Charge carriers; Disordered solids; Gaussian or dispersive transport; Theory","Calculations; Charge carriers; Dielectric materials; Electric conductivity; Electron mobility; Electron transport properties; Mathematical models; Molecular structure; Polymers; Charge carrier transport; Disordered solids; Gaussian disorder model; Gaussian transport; Time-of-flight method; Solids",,,,,,,09540083,,,"English","High Perform Polym",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037336931

The tools are based on multi-criteria exploration of the whole variety of possible environmental decision alternatives that helps to understand the feasibility frontiers and individual selecting several preferred feasible decision alternatives.

The equations thus obtained imply a ""compatibility "" condition and are known as a nonlinear Lax pair thus variable coefficients. So we propose a method for constructing such pairs. To construct solutions of a more complicated form, we propose to use the ""property of zero denomiators and factorized brackets,"" which has been discovered experimentally. The expressions thus constructed are said to be ""quasi-invariant."" They allow us to find true relations between the functions contained in the ansatz, to correct the ansatz, and to construct a solution.

The parameters characterizing the change of charge state in the MOS structures during the modification have been monitored by means of time dependence of voltage shift applied to a sample during the injection. It was found that the changes in the range of threshold voltage in MOS devices, which resulted from the electron injection, could reach values up to 6 V, while the range is extended with the growth of the concentration of phosphorus in the PSG layer.

The ultimate range of electrons was somewhat below the layer thickness. The Monte Carlo method was used to determine the basic transport characteristics of fast electrons in polymers (maximum range, depth distribution of absorbed dose and forward current). It was shown that significant steady-state currents (1 to 10% of the electron beam current) were observed only if the thickness of blocking (unirradiated) layer did not exceed 5 μm. The magnitude of these currents was almost unaffected by the polymer type (polymers with minimum radiation-induced conductivity and polymers with electron or hole conductivity were examined). It was found that conventional theories of conductivity of dielectrics failed to explain the observed experimental data.

Published data on transient radiation-induced conductivity of polymers, including the model polymer poly(vinylcarbazole), are analyzed. It was shown that these data provide evidence of the nonequilibrium (dispersive) transport of charge carriers over the entire experimentally accessible range of observation time (from tens of nanoseconds to tens of minutes at room temperature). Using poly(vinylcarbazole) as an example, it was found that the dispersive transport of holes is also supported by time-of-flight measurements, provided, however, that special precautions are taken to exclude undesirable methodological effects. The generally accepted treatment of charge transport as a quasi-equilibrium phenomenon for which the plateau on the time-of-flight current transient is treated in terms of the Gaussian disorder model requires substantial revision. More detailed analysis over a broader time interval, especially for long times, and the involvement of data on radiation-induced conductivity in molecularly doped polymers in consideration evidently show the dispersive nature of charge carrier transport in such polymer systems as well. The formation of the plateau on the time-of-flight curve seems to be due to the effect of the near-surface polymer layer whose role in the radiation-induced conductivity is reduced to a minimum because of the bulk generation of charge carriers. The transport parameters are given for some polymers and the drift displacements of the majority carriers in them are calculated for several time intervals. Reasons for the unique photoelectric properties of poly(vinylcarbazole) are discussed.",,"carbazole derivative; polymer; article; conductance; dispersion; electron transport; electrophoretic mobility; equilibrium constant; intermethod comparison; irradiation; mathematical computing; molecular model; room temperature; theoretical model; transport kinetics",,,,,,,15600904,,,"English","Polym.

It is shown that the best fit of the model to experiment is achieved with a truncated exponential energy distribution of traps which implies that the effective mobility decays by a power law over a fairly long period of time (from 100 μs to ∼1 s at 300 K). In attempting to account for the time history of the effective mobility at very short times (≤1 μ) and its dependence on temperature under the nonequilibrium (dispersion) transport conditions, based on the disorder model, H.Bässler ran into severe problems of a fundamental nature. A comprehensive comparison of the available models for transfer of excess charge carriers in polymers doped on a molecular level is currently hampered by the dearth of authentic data on rotational diffusion of dopant molecules in vitrified matrices. The underlying principles of the time-of-flight method surveyed at length in this study call into question the possibility of detecting quasi-equilibrium transport in polymers doped on a molecular level at room and nearly room temperatures.

Given the Russian tradition of disloyalty to rules, however, all attempts to establish some sort of Rechtsstaat (law and order) are likely to fail in the short run. It is essential for the government to build social capital through more public consultation and improved accountability to the public. But the development of civil society in Russia will take time.

It is shown that such a system is described by generalized convolution, which, in turn, is represented as a cascade connection of interpolators and decimators with integer-valued conversion coefficients.

Additional electrodes or waveguide structures providing a feedback between the slow-wave system and the cathode are used. The particular form of cathode feedback depends on the type of the slow-wave system used and the cathode. In some cases, the cathode can be placed into a slow-wave system. As a result of emission modulation, a RF current arises at the cathode, and, at a high output power, electron bunches are created that enter a strong RF field of the backward wave when they come into a slow-wave system. Therefore, when the phase of these bunches relative to the field is correctly chosen, they will give up their energy to the field with high efficiency, which exceeds the efficiency of the ordinary BWO. For designing the carcinotrode characteristics, an approximate nonlinear theory and numerical simulation have been developed. The possibility of increasing the efficiency considerably, for example, from 15% in a conventional BWO up to 35% and more, is shown. It has also been shown that it is possible to produce a circuit feedback providing a wide band for the electron to change the frequency in the carcinotrode.",,,,,,,,,10642269,,JTELE,"English","J Commun Technol Electron",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042782563

The use of SWS for RF-measurement transducers makes it possible quite efficiently to monitor and measure parameters of various industrial processes and materials. Difficulties arise when monitoring and measuring parameters of oil-liquids such as the conductivity or the continuity of flow. This is caused by the strong screening action of the monitored oil-liquid on electromagnetic field of the slowed wave in the helical sensitive elements (HSE). As the conductivity increases, the screening become even stronger, and this leads to a reduction in the sensitivity and measurement accuracy. The solution of such problems requires the creation and modeling of more complex designs of sensitive elements in which the screening action is weakened. Such an effect can be achieved by matching the field of a hybrid slowed wave to the medium being monitored, utilizing HSE based on layered magnetic and dielectric structures with a smooth variation of the electrodynamic parameters.","Helical sensitive element; Oil monitoring; Slow wave structure","Dielectric properties; Electric conductivity measurement; Electrodynamics; Electromagnetic waves; Lubricating oils; Mathematical models; Monitoring; Sensitivity analysis; Helical sensitive element; Oil monitoring; Slow wave structures; Transducers","SPIE",,"Industrial Sensing Systems","5 November 2000 through 6 November 2000","Boston, MA",58056,0277786X,,PSISD,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034453932

The real improvements, in so far as they are simply the results of devaluation and the beneficial effects of the increase in the world oil price, could prove to be temporary, although there are more hopeful indicators with the recent increases in investment. But to ensure sustainable recovery, fundamental improvements in the structure of the economy, especially in the areas of industrial and financial restructuring, are needed.

A common mathematical framework is suggested for all these purposes. This framework is the theory of restricted K-calculuses and K-languages (RKCL-theory), published by the author in Informatica, 1996, No. 1, 1998, No. 4. The suggested mathematical framework possesses all expressive possibilities of the Semantic Language published in 1999 in Geneva by the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA SL) and of FIPA Agent Communication Language (FIPA ACL). Besides, this framework provides many advantages in comparison with FIPA SL. One of the principal advantages is that a collection of 10 rules is suggested such that one is able to construct the representations of the contents (or structured meanings) of arbitrary natural language discourses and, as a consequence, to construct the representations of arbitrarily complicated goals, actions, and negotiation protocols proceeding from elementary informational items and applying these rules. As a result, the RKCL-theory allows for building compound designations of arbitrary entities considered in the field of EC: sets, finite sequences, relationships, concepts, and structured meanings of texts. That is why the described framework is called an ontological framework. It is shown that the expressive power of restricted standard K-languages exceeds the expressive power of the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and RDF Schema Specification Language elaborated in 1998-1999 by the WWW-Consortium. It is suggested to use the RKCL-theory as a reference-point and a tool for developing more powerful and flexible conceptual formalisms for the advanced, semantically-structured Web.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computational grammars; Data communication systems; Electronic commerce; Integral equations; Knowledge representation; Natural language processing systems; Network protocols; Text processing; Agent communication language; Integral formal semantics; Multi agent systems; Resource description framework; Restricted K calculuses; Universal conceptual metagrammar; World Wide Web",,"Slovene Society Informatika, Ljubljana, Slovenia",,,,,03505596,,INFOF,"English","Inf",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034156981

Using interview data, it examines the mechanics of barter settlements and classifies the main types of non-monetary transactions. The major reason for barter is lack of a competitive monetary system. In the 1990s barter represented a specific vehicle to perform settlements. Barter itself is not a way to evade taxes or to defraud enterprises of assets. But barter changed the motivation of enterprises and led to systematic distortion of accounting data. The low transparency of the barter economy creates barriers for investment and restructuring. The barter economy is an insider's economy. The lack of affiliated entity regulation and mechanisms for disclosure of transactions with related parties stimulates insiders to criminal application of barter and monetary surrogates. Barter has become a profitable business for a number of important economic agents including financial intermediaries affiliated with top managers of the biggest privatised enterprises and government agencies.",,"bargaining; economic conditions; national economy; Russian Federation",,"Carfax Publishing Company",,,,,14631377,,PCECF,"English","Post-Communist Econ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033736103

The focus is on the individual savings market, which exhibits inefficiencies, including those associated with the market power of a dominant agent-Sberbank. Reinforcement of Sberbank's dominance on the market in the period 1994-98 (before the August default combined with financial crisis) is explained as a consequence of asymmetric information about the probability of bankruptcy of a new bank. Under asymmetric information a new private bank has to provide specific quality signals in order to attract depositors. Two major lines of inquiry are the criteria for choosing forms of savings, including that of a bank in which to deposit money, by Russian citizens, and banks' advertising strategies to confirm the factual risk of default. Within the conceptual framework of a game with separating equilibrium, we analyse the behaviour of the agents on both supply and demand sides in the market. We find that there is evidence of using advertising as a tool of quality signalling at a certain phase of the Russian individual savings market's development.",,"banking; financial market; savings; Russian Federation",,"Carfax Publishing Company",,,,,14631377,,PCECF,"English","Post-Communist Econ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033940369

In conventional gyrodevices electron bunching occurs due to the relativistic changing of electron mass. However, if in a gyrotron or gyroklystron the cathode in placed in a RF field of the resonator, this will result in emission modulation and the electron bunches will be created right on the cathode. The emission modulation is especially effective in devices with field emission. A flat diode model with a magnetic slanting static field is used to investigate the interaction of electron bunches with electromagnetic RF field. This model describes in a unified way the conventional diode, the gyroresonance mode and the flat magnetron with a transverse RF field.

To date, there has been little empirical analysis of such avoidance behavior. Based on a recently completed survey of 615 households in Moscow, this paper investigates the types and amounts of avoidance measures that are used by households in Moscow to adjust drinking water quality. Survey results show that this is clearly the case: over 88 per cent of the sample boil water regularly due to concerns about water quality; 23 per cent filter water regularly; over 30 per cent settle water regularly; and about 13 per cent buy bottled water regularly. On the other hand, residents are generally content with their cold water supply and quality of delivery. Based on a microeconomic model of household avoidance behavior, logit regression results show how avoidance decisions relate to income, opinions of water quality, and location in the city. It is expected that this analysis from Moscow can also be used as a guide for future studies in other cities in Russia to evaluate opinions of quality, avoidance measures, and citizens willingness to support public infrastructure projects designed to improve water supply.

That framework is the theory of restricted K-calcules and K-languages, or the RKCL-theory, published in Informatica, 1996, No. 1. The essence of the new framework is as follows. 10 operations on formal representations of conceptual structures are suggested. The contents of arbitrary messages and arbitrary communicative acts may be represented by the strings built out of primitive conceptual items by means of these 10 operations. The RKCL-theory possesses the expressive possibilities exceeding the expressive possibilities of the ACL published in October 1997 in Geneva by the international Federation of Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA). The main advantages are, in particular, the possibilities to represent arbitrarily complicated goals (actions) and structured meanings of arbitrary discourses in natural language. The new framework enables us both to define syntax of ACLs and to formalize their semantics. The paper suggests also a little modified variant of the RKCL-theory without changing the expressive power of that theory.","Agent communication language; Communicative act; Electronic commerce; FIPA ACL; Integral formal semantics; Internet; Multi-agent system; Natural language; Ontology; Restricted K-calculus; Restricted standard K-language; Semantic representation; Semantics; Syntax",,,,,,,,03505596,,INFOF,"English","Inf",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0347600884

The superdiamagnetic model is based on the assumption that the planetary rings consist of the superconducting particles. The huge number of superconducting particles in the planet's magnetic field demonstrated behavior comparable to superdiamagnetic liquid film. The superdiamagnetic concept of the planetary rings makes it possible to add classical theories, and to resolve as yet unsolved problems as will be shown below. The superdiamagnetic model of planetary rings suggests a new explanation of phenomena like radio and MMwave radiation, and reflection and absorption as demonstrated in Saturn's rings. Problems of planetary rings./Physical effect (distinctive parameter). (1) Phenomenon of anomalous inversion reflection of radiowaves (greater than 1 cm) with circular polarization./Expected effect at reflection of radiowaves (greater than 3 mm (with circular polarization from superconductors. (2) High reflection and low brightness of the ring particles in the radiofrequency range./Existence of critical frequency (approximately 1011 Hz), above which electromagnetic waves are absorbed and below which ones are fully reflected. (3) Own wide band pulse radiation of the Saturn's rings within the range 20.4 kHz - 40.2 MHz./Non- stationary Josephson effect: generation of electromagnetic waves by Josephson's contact (with frequency 4,83594 (DOT) 1014 Hz/V). (4) Frequency anomalies in the thermal radiation of the Saturn's rings in the spectrum range 100 micrometer - 1 cm./Existence of energetic slit (approximately 10-4eV) in energetic spectrum of superconductor electrons. ©2003 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Planetary rings; Radiation, reflection and absorption; Superconducting particles; Superdiamagnetic liquid","Josephson; Josephson effects; Non stationary; Physical effects; Planetary rings; Pulse radiation; Radiation, reflection and absorption; Radio frequency ranges; Saturn's (planetary) rings; Spectrum range; Superconducting particles; Superdiamagnetic liquid; Wide bands; Absorption; Cements; Circular polarization; Electric conductivity; Electromagnetic wave diffraction; Electromagnetic wave scattering; Electromagnetic waves; Liquid films; Magnetic fields; Millimeter waves; Optical instruments; Optical telescopes; Polarization; Programming theory; Reflection; Satellites; Superconducting magnets; Superconducting materials; Superconductivity; Telescopes; Thickness measurement; Planets",,,"Advanced Technology MMW, Radio, and Terahertz Telescopes","26 March 1998 through 26 March 1998","Kona, HI",75224,0277786X,,PSISD,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-58749098951

The root-mean-square deviation for this distribution is surface roughness, which depends on the distribution type chosen. It is shown that surface roughness can be studied either within the Euclidean metric in terms of the moment method or within the Hausdorff dimensional representation in terms of fractal geometry. These approaches, being independent of each other, have specific features and areas of application of their own. Algorithms to evaluate roughness parameters, autocorrelation function, and spectral power density are presented. The surface characteristics for polySi, SiO2, and cellulose films at wavelengths from 5 to 5 × 105 nm were obtained. It was demonstrated that the autocorrelation function reflects roughness scale variety and begins to depend on surface relief as the scale reduces.",,,,,,,,,10637397,,,"English","Russ.

One of the main problems for the theory of stochastic hereditary equations and their applications is connected with stability. Many stability results were obtained by the construction of appropriate Lyapunov functionals. In [7-11], the procedure is proposed, allowing, in some sense, to formalize the algorithm of the corresponding Lyapunov functionals construction for stochastic functional differential equations, for stochastic difference equations.

The remainder terms are small if all four moments of variables are bounded and a special average measure of quadratic forms is small. Three statistical problems are considered under the G-analysis approach (for normal populations): (1) estimating the mean of a random vector with independent components and variance 1, (2) discrimination of two populations with common unknown covariance matrix, and (3) linear regression in case of random predictors and random response. Regularized and generalized procedures are considered depending on an arbitrary a priori function of finite variation.

What has to be evaluated is whether the system of private property rights and the enforcement of these rights have created a perverse governance structure, which only serves to strengthen the position of special interest groups in exploiting the assets of the enterprise, or whether the reforms have created a variety of ownership structures which will allow effective turnaround strategies to be designed and implemented. This article presents and discusses the results of a longitudinal survey of 20 privatised companies in Russian industry. All of the companies surveyed were initially privatised by the so-called 'second' method of voucher privatisation, which transferred a controlling interest to the employees. The first results of the survey were presented in our previous article in this journal. In the present article we try to map the changes in decision-making structures and control arrangements that occurred in privatised companies in 1994-96. The article is organised as follows. In the first section we briefly recall the basic legal patterns of company restructuring in Russia. The second section gives an overview of the research methodology: the measures used and the principles of sample selection. The third section presents the main results of the longitudinal survey, especially the comparison between 1994, 1995 and 1996.

Conversion is also undertaken concomitant with the emergence of a decentralised but a more and more theoretical money-based commercial economy (step backwards of the money-based economy, high transaction costs, barter). There are indeed specific constraints associated with the defense sector but these cannot be isolated from a more global analysis so long as the situation in the country's institutions and operating systems remains precarious.

The required pressure is found to decrease significantly with increasing strain-rate sensitivity exponent ma of blank material at any value of friction coefficient. Influence of the latter on the required pressure is pronounced at lower values of ma and becomes very week for superplastic and Newtonian-viscous materials. The control of strain-rate regime has been used in isothermal bulk forming of a lid of VT3-1 titanium (α+β) alloy (Ti - 6%A1 - 2,5%Mo - 1,5%Cr - 0,5%Fe) to maintain superplastic state in possibly largest volume fraction of the blank. This approach provides the possibility to get the highest, for any particular case, efficiency of practical application of superplasticity in bulk forming with regard to required forming force and productivity of the process.","Bulk forming; Contact friction; Optimized tool velocity; Rheological behaviour","Computer simulation; Finite element method; Friction; Rheology; Strain; Stresses; Superplasticity; Volume fraction; Blank material; Superplastic bulk forming; Forming",,,,,,,02555476,,MSFOE,"English","Mater Sci Forum",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-5244238927

For a small field, after guantum averaging, the Hamiltonian is represented in terms of generators with quadratic commutation relations. The irreducible representations of this quadratic algebra are realized on hypergeometric states.

This work was intended in order to show that the intraventricular trabeculation plays the determining role in such a flow formation and to find some analytical approaches for its analysis. The morphometric study of human left-ventricular and aortic corrosion casts and dynamic measurement of the aorta by MRI- technique were performed. The data were analysed by means of the 'Mathematica' program. Two groups of trabecules were identified that refer to the inlet and outlet of the ventricular blood flow. The first group consists of trabecules of the free left-ventricular wall. The second group consists of long trabecules going along the anterior left-ventricular wall and intracavital lines of the papillary muscles. Both are twisted clockwise and converge in the flow direction. Each group of trabecules is oriented towards the mitral or aortic valve orifices, correspondingly. It was concluded that the helical trabecular organization acts as flow directing paddles that change their mutual orientation during the cardiac cycle evolution. The reorientation of the flow takes place due to sequential contraction of the ventricular structures. The formalization of trabecular orientation will allow one to calculate improved models of implantable substitutes and auxiliary devices for cardiovascular surgery.The presence of twisted helical flow patterns in the cardiac cavities during ventricular filling and ejection was supposed. This work was intended in order to show that the intraventricular trabeculation plays the determining role in such a flow formation and to find some analytical approaches for its analysis. The morphometric study of human left-ventricular and aortic corrosion casts and dynamic measurement of the aorta by MRI-technique were performed. The data were analysed by means of the 'Mathematica' program. Two groups of trabecules were identified that refer to the inlet and outlet of the ventricular blood flow. The first group consists of trabecules of the free left-ventricular wall. The second group consists of long trabecules going along the anterior left-ventricular wall and intracavital lines of the papillary muscles. Both are twisted clockwise and converge in the flow direction. Each group of trabecules is oriented towards the mitral or aortic valve orifices, correspondingly. It was concluded that the helical trabecular organization acts as flow directing paddles that change their mutual orientation during the cardiac cycle evolution. The reorientation of the flow takes place due to sequential contraction of the ventricular structures.

They are valid uniformly for all values of the field's magnitude. These series correspond to families (stable in the linear approximation) of periodic and conditionally periodic motions of a classical electron in the plane orthogonal to the direction of the field. The corresponding semiclassical wavefunctions have the property of quantum 'superscaring' in the coordinate space near these classical trajectories of motion. We obtain the limit cases of our semiclassical energy levels for strong and weak magnetic fields.

The corrected emission spectra show apparent mirror symmetry to the longest wavelength absorption maximum. In view of high molar extinction coefficient of the longest wavelength maximum in absorption spectra, constant polarization of fluorescence across it in dioxane and high values of quantum yields of Buorescence, τ→τ* character of corresponding electronic transition was proposed. Roughly linear correlation was found between transition energies and quantum yields of fluorescence on the one hand, and polarity of solvents expressed in Kosower's ‘Z’ values (excepting acetic acid) on the other. In preliminary experiments it was found that lumiflavin in dioxane and in acetic acid is strongly photodecomposed by the monochromatic(436 nm) light. Copyright © 1969, Wiley Blackwell.
