Methods addressing this problem commonly search for clusters of pattern occurrences that are statistically significant. A measure of statistical significance is the P-value of a number of pattern occurrences, i.e. the probability to find at least S occurrences of words from a pattern in a random text of length N generated according to a given probability model. All words of the pattern are supposed to be of same length. Results: We present a novel algorithm SufPref that computes an exact P-value for Hidden Markov models (HMM). The algorithm is based on recursive equations on text sets related to pattern occurrences; the equations can be used for any probability model. The algorithm inductively traverses a specific data structure, an overlap graph. The nodes of the graph are associated with the overlaps of words from . The edges are associated to the prefix and suffix relations between overlaps. An originality of our data structure is that pattern need not be explicitly represented in nodes or leaves. The algorithm relies on the Cartesian product of the overlap graph and the graph of HMM states; this approach is analogous to the automaton approach from JBCB 4: 553-569. The gain in size of SufPref data structure leads to significant improvements in space and time complexity compared to existent algorithms. The algorithm SufPref was implemented as a C++ program; the program can be used both as Web-server and a stand alone program for Linux and Windows. The program interface admits special formats to describe probability models of various types (HMM, Bernoulli, Markov); a pattern can be described with a list of words, a PSSM, a degenerate pattern or a word and a number of mismatches. It is available at http://server2.lpm.org.ru/bio/online/sf/ . The program was applied to compare sensitivity and specificity of methods for TFBS prediction based on P-values computed for Bernoulli models, Markov models of orders one and two and HMMs. The experiments show that the methods have approximately the same qualities. © 2014 Regnier et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Hidden Markov model; P-value; Pattern occurrences; PSSM (PWM)",,,"BioMed Central Ltd.",,,,,17487188,,,"English","Algorithms Mol.

Using the first order approximation allows significantly enhancing the validity time period for the analytical model if compared with the linearised solution, allowing using the long-term experimental breakthrough concentration history for the model adjustment. Laboratory injection tests for three size colloids are performed. The asymptotic solution is used to tune the model parameters from the breakthrough histories of two size particles; good quality of matching is observed.

Additionally, they remain liquid within a temperature range of 0-100°C.

In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to assess at the atomistic level the structure and dynamics of a series of model archaeal membranes with lipids that have tetraether chemical nature and ""branched"" hydrophobic tails. We conclude that the branched structure defines dense packing and low water permeability of archaeal-like membranes, while at the same time ensuring a liquid-crystalline state, which is vital for living cells. This makes tetraether lipid systems promising in bionanotechnology and material science, namely for design of new and unique membrane nanosystems.",,"artificial membrane; lipid bilayer; membrane lipid; water; archaeon; artificial membrane; biophysics; cell membrane; chemistry; lipid bilayer; metabolism; molecular dynamics; Archaea; Biophysical Phenomena; Cell Membrane; Lipid Bilayers; Membrane Lipids; Membranes, Artificial; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Water",,"Nature Publishing Group",,,,,20452322,,,"English","Sci.

Presently the majority of countries participate in national testing; however, the past two decades have seen a substantial shift in test characteristics and aims. This article investigates the global transformation toward testing for accountability, where intentional or unintentional positive or negative consequences are applied to educators (teachers and administrators) based on their student’s test scores, in light of the emerging global culture, identified by World Culture theorists. Elements of the world culture – including the expansion of western education models, an emphasis on academic intelligence, faith in science as a rational path to truth, and the decentralization of authority to the local level – justify the establishment of testing for accountability systems. Descriptive evidence from regional and international datasets, such as PISA, PIRLS, and TIMSS, illustrate the speed at which this transformation occurs. The convergence of countries toward testing for accountability and its position as an increasingly normative policy lever is illustrated in brief vignettes from the diverse systems of Hungary, Mexico, and South Korea. As testing for accountability becomes embedded in the world culture as a legitimate tool for education reform it is less prone to critical reflection. If the potential benefits and concerns of testing for accountability, outlined in this article, are not thoughtfully evaluated this global transformation will lead to a testing culture that is internalized as normative and adopted as individual values. © 2014, Arizona State University.

Novel forms of political dialog have become widespread in new media, especially in terms of dialog initiated by ""ordinary"" people, who use irony and visual images to express their dissatisfaction with politicians' activities. This study suggests the characteristics of a special aspect of a computer-mediated political discourse in Russia. It demonstrates contextual and instrumental features of a visual political irony in new media based on a case study of the LiveJournal Internet community ""Potsreotizm"". An analysis of the instruments that members of this Internet community use to create visual irony leads to the conclusion that in the virtual space, myths and concepts created by the political elite are being constantly interpreted with the help of irony and humor, and people increasingly treat these myths and concepts critically at the level of daily social routine. Reflection, context and visual representation, which are necessary to create ironical discourse, offer original vocabularies for organizing public dialog within new media.

Consistent with the theory on precautionary cash savings by firms, we further find that firms non-recipients based in cities with low banking development accumulated more cash holdings than recipients based in cities with a high banking development.

The key question is whether the quality of these new BRIC engineers will be high enough to actualize this potential. The objective of our study is to assess the evolving capacity of BRIC higher education systems to produce qualified engineering graduates. To meet this objective, we compare developments in the quality of undergraduate engineering programs across elite and non-elite higher education tiers within and across each BRIC country. To assess and compare the quality of engineering education across the BRIC countries, we use multiple sources of primary and secondary data gathered from each BRIC country from 2008 to 2011. In combination with this, we utilize a production function approach that focuses on key input-, process- and outcome-based indicators associated with the quality of education programs. Our analysis suggests that in all four countries, a minority of engineering students receives high quality training in elite institutions while the majority of students receive low quality training in non-elite institutions.

MEG was recorded in 14 subjects under three conditions: bilateral synchronous movements of both index fingers (BILATERAL), movements of the right hand index finger while observing the immobile left index finger (NOMIRROR), and movements of the right hand index finger while observing its mirror reflection (MIRROR). The right hemispheric spatiospectral regions of interests (ROIs) in the sensor space, sensitive to bilateral movements, were found by statistical comparison of the BILATERAL spectral responses to baseline. For these ROIs, the post-movement HGO responses were compared between the MIRROR and NOMIRROR conditions. We found that MVF from the moving hand, similarly to the real movements of the opposite hand, induced HGOs (55-85. Hz) in the sensorimotor cortex. This MVF effect was frequency-specific and did not spread to oscillations in other frequency bands. This is the first study demonstrating movement-related HGO induced by MVF from the moving hand in the absence of proprioceptive feedback signaling.

For N even, the Hamiltonian has a symmetry which makes the spectrum doubly degenerate leading to two independent stochastic processes.

A semiphenomenological coarse-grained model for semiflexible polyelectrolyte chains in solution is proposed. The coarse-grained model permits one to focus on the essential features of these systems and provides significant computational advantages with respect to more detailed models. Our approach relies on the method of Gaussian equivalent representation for the calculation of the partition functions in the form of functional integrals. This method provides reliable thermodynamic information for polyelectrolyte solutions over wide ranges of monomer concentrations. In the present work, we use the comparison and fitting of the experimental osmotic pressure with a theoretical equation of state within the Gaussian equivalent representation.

Recent neuroimaging studies in monolinguals indicated that core language areas in human neocortex together with sensorimotor structures form a highly interactive system underpinning native language comprehension. While the experience of a native speaker promotes the establishment of strong action-perception links in the comprehension network, this may not necessarily be the case for L2 where, as it has been argued, the most a typical L2 speaker may get is a link between an L2 wordform and its L1 translation equivalent. Therefore, we investigated, whether the motor cortex of bilingual subjects shows differential involvement in processing action semantics of native and non-native words. We used high-density EEG to dynamically measure changes in the cortical motor system's activity, indexed by event-related desynchronisation (ERD) of the mu-rhythm, in response to passively reading L1 (German) and L2 (English) action words. Analysis of motor-related EEG oscillations at the sensor level revealed an early (starting ~. 150. ms) and left-lateralised coupling between action and semantics during both L1 and L2 processing. Crucially, source-level activation in the motor areas showed that mu-rhythm ERD, while present for both languages, is significantly stronger for L1 words. This is the first neurophysiological evidence of rapid motor-cortex involvement during L2 action-semantic processing. Our results both strengthen embodied cognition evidence obtained previously in monolinguals and, at the same time, reveal important quantitative differences between L1 and L2 sensorimotor brain activity in language comprehension. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Electroencephalography (EEG); Embodied cognition; Event-related desyncronisation (ERD); Lexical semantics; Motor cortex; Mu rhythm; Second-language processing (L2)","adult; Article; brain function; cognition; comprehension; electroencephalography; evoked response; female; human; human experiment; information processing; language ability; male; motor cortex; mu rhythm; neocortex; neurophysiology; normal human; oscillation; perception; reading; semantics; sensorimotor cortex; sensorimotor function; volunteer; comprehension; electroencephalogram; motor cortex; multilingualism; physiology; Adult; Brain Waves; Comprehension; Female; Humans; Male; Motor Cortex; Multilingualism; Semantics",,"Academic Press Inc.",,,,,10538119,,NEIME,"English","NeuroImage",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907160933

All three efforts are occurring at a time when the international system is in flux and the ability of the USA and other Western powers to deliver key global collective goods is being called into question.

Demand Responsive Transport systems (DRT) that provide a share transportation services with flexible routes and focus on optimizing of economic and environmental value are becoming an important part of public transportation. In this paper we propose a new approach to design of DRT models which considers DRT as a multi-agent system (MAS) where various autonomous agents represent interests of system's stakeholders. The distributed nature of the MAS facilitates design of scalable implementations in modern cloud environments. We also propose a planning algorithm based on combinatorial auctions (CA) that allows to express commodity of multiple transportation scenarios by evident means of the bids. Using the mechanism of CA we may fully take into account the presence of complementariness and substitutability among the items that differ across bidders. Further, we describe design principles of our proposed software with a prototype implementation. We believe that our approach to multi-agent modeling is general enough to provide the flexibility necessary for adoption of DRT-services modeling into real-world scenarios.

In this work we analyze stock markets of the USA and Sweden. We study cluster structures of a market network constructed from a correlation matrix of returns of the stocks traded in each of these markets. Such cluster structures are obtained by means of the P-Median Problem (PMP) whose objective is to maximize the total correlation between a set of stocks called medians of size p and other stocks. Every cluster structure is an undirected disconnected weighted graph in which every connected component (cluster) is a star, or a tree with one central node (called a median) and several leaf nodes connected with the median by weighted edges. Our main observation is that in non-crisis periods of time cluster structures change more chaotically, while during crises they show more stable behavior and fewer changes. Thus an increasing stability of a market graph cluster structure obtained via the PMP could be used as an indicator of a coming crisis. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The time course of lexical access, as well as lexical selection and integration was studied using a visual-world paradigm in three groups of Russian speakers: 36 individuals in the control group, 15 individuals with non-fluent aphasia and eight individuals with fluent aphasia. Participants listened to temporarily ambiguous sentences wherein the context biased the interpretation of an ambiguous word toward one of its two meanings. In half of the experimental sentences, a reanalysis was needed upon encountering the disambiguating phrase. The effect of the length of the intervening material between the ambiguous word and the disambiguation point was additionally monitored. All groups of participants showed intact lexical access under slowed speech rate, but non-fluent participants experienced difficulties with timely activation of multiple referents. At later stages of lexical processing, they additionally demonstrated a specific impairment of reanalysis. The deficit in participants with fluent aphasia was not focalized at any specific stage of lexical processing. Rather, the breakdown of lexical processes in fluent aphasia was likely related to difficulties with the inhibition of irrelevant lexical activation, which is further supported by the finding that increased phonological distance between the ambiguous word and ambiguity resolution was influential to the offline performance in this group. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Ambiguity; Aphasia; Eye-tracking; Lexical processing","accuracy; adult; aged; ambiguity; aphasia; Article; brain damage; clinical article; comprehension; controlled study; eye fixation; eye tracking; female; fluent aphasia; human; left hemisphere; male; middle aged; neuroimaging; nonfluent aphasia; phonetics; response time; Russian (people); speech rate",,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,00283932,,NUPSA,"English","Neuropsychologia",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908616683

While complex spatio-temporal dynamics are a hallmark of neuronal oscillations, they also represent a formidable challenge for the proper extraction and quantification of oscillatory activity with non-invasive recording techniques such as EEG and MEG. In order to facilitate the study of neuronal oscillations we present a general-purpose pre-processing approach, which can be applied for a wide range of analyses including but not restricted to inverse modeling and multivariate single-trial classification. The idea is to use dimensionality reduction with spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD) instead of the commonly and almost exclusively used principal component analysis (PCA). The key advantage of SSD lies in selecting components explaining oscillations-related variance instead of just any variance as in the case of PCA. For the validation of SSD pre-processing we performed extensive simulations with different inverse modeling algorithms and signal-to-noise ratios. In all these simulations SSD invariably outperformed PCA often by a large margin. Moreover, using a database of multichannel EEG recordings from 80 subjects we show that pre-processing with SSD significantly increases the performance of single-trial classification of imagined movements, compared to the classification with PCA pre-processing or without any dimensionality reduction. Our simulations and analysis of real EEG experiments show that, while not being supervised, the SSD algorithm is capable of extracting components primarily relating to the signal of interest often using as little as 20% of the data variance, instead of > 90% variance as in case of PCA. Given its ease of use, absence of supervision, and capability to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of multivariate EEG/MEG data, we advocate the application of SSD pre-processing for the analysis of spontaneous and induced neuronal oscillations in normal subjects and patients. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Brain oscillations; Dimensionality reduction; Principal component analysis; Spatio-spectral decomposition","adult; analysis of variance; Article; brain computer interface; brain electrophysiology; brain oscillation; computer simulation; controlled study; data analysis; electroencephalogram; human; learning algorithm; magnetoencephalography; multifactor dimensionality reduction; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; principal component analysis; signal noise ratio; spatial analysis; spatio spectral decomposition algorithm; theory validation; brain; electroencephalography; physiology; procedures; signal processing; statistical analysis; Adult; Brain; Brain Waves; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Electroencephalography; Humans; Magnetoencephalography; Principal Component Analysis; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",,"Academic Press Inc.",,,,,10538119,,NEIME,"English","NeuroImage",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907034185

At an ambient pressure, with decreasing temperature a drastic drop in χ(T) was confirmed at T≃ 6065K, which appears to be closely related to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering. It is found that the magnitudes of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility Δχ in the AFM phase are close in the studied samples, whereas the sign of the anisotropy apparently depends on the small variations of the excess iron y in Fe1+yTe samples. The performed DFT calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic properties for the stoichiometric FeTe compound indicate the presence of frustrated AFM ground states. There are very close energies and magnetic moments for the double stripe configurations, with the AFM axes oriented either on the basal plane or along the [0 0 1] direction. Presumably, both these configurations can be realized in Fe1+yTe single crystals, depending on the variations of the excess iron. This can provide different signs of magnetic anisotropy in the AFM phase, presently observed in the Fe1+yTe samples. For these types of AFM configuration, the calculations for the FeTe values of Δχ are consistent with our experimental data. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.","electronic structure; Fe-based superconductors; FeTe; magnetic anisotropy; magnetic susceptibility","Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic susceptibility; Fe-based superconductors; FeTe; Electronic structure",,"Institute of Physics Publishing",,,,,09538984,,JCOME,"English","J Phys Condens Matter",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907842159

Building the Innovation City is a challenge due to the differences in the objectives and goals of the participating sides: governmental, industry, academic, and research organizations. The new city is being built from scratch next to Kazan', the capital of Tatarstan Republic - this is also a challenge by itself. The idea is to use the synergy of IT academicians, researchers and practitioners in a single location. The Innovation City will incorporate a kindergarten, a STEM training school, a university and an IT park. Of these, the university will act as the brain for the entire project. The primary focus of the university curricula is software engineering. Currently, Innoplois faculty training is underway at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), the birthplace of the software engineering, and the top ranked university in the field. Research and project practice are tightly coupled within the CMU SE master's program, the CMU course sequence is well justified, while each individual course is thoroughly planned. However, direct curricula copying from CMU to Innopolis would be too obvious solution to be correct. The paper discusses ways of context-specific adjustment of the CMU MSE courses to meet the new Russian university objectives. These curricula tailoring suggestions are based on the takeaways from the author's recent CMU visiting faculty experience, the primary focus of which has been SE training to be applied at Innopolis shortly.

The site of action and the underlying mechanism, however, are unclear. Here we applied a circuit modeling approach, supported by electrochemical in vivo recordings, to clarify this issue. Modeling revealed two potential mechanisms for the drop in accumbal dopamine efflux evoked by the selective α7 partial agonist TC-7020. TC-7020 could desensitize α7 NNRs located predominantly on dopamine neurons or glutamatergic afferents to them or, alternatively, activate α7 NNRs located on the glutamatergic afferents to GABAergic interneurons in the ventral tegmental area. Only the model based on desensitization, however, was able to explain the neutralizing effect of coapplied PNU-120596, a positive allosteric modulator. According to our results, the most likely sites of action are the preterminal α7 NNRs controlling glutamate release from cortical afferents to the nucleus accumbens.

The article then demonstrates the ambiguity of the modernisation concept that EU member states promote to Russia, making it an empty signifier. To illustrate the difference among EU member states, the article makes use of discourse analysis to first design a scale of Russia's attitude to various political aspects of modernisation and to then posit member states on this scale on the basis of what they inserted in their Ps4M with Russia. It is argued that Russia in its dialogue with the EU faces ambiguity of the concept, which it is supposed to adopt. Furthermore, a new classification of EU member states emerges, based on the extent to which they are ready to defend political modernisation (and ultimately the EU's normative power) in their relations with Russia. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.","democracy; EU–Russian relations; human rights; institutional reform; modernisation; normative power; partnership for modernisation; the rule of law",,,"Routledge",,,,,14782804,,,"English","J.

The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First we study the singularities of the above spaces (as was explained by Finkelberg and Mirković in 1999 and Braverman in 2006 they are supposed to model singularities of the not rigorously defined ``semi-infinite Schubert varieties''). We show that Za gis normal and when g is simply laced, Za g is Gorenstein and has rational singularities; some weaker results are proved also in the affine case. The second purpose is to study the character of the ring of functions on Za g. When g is finite-dimensional and simply laced we show that the generating function of these characters satisfies the ``fermionic formula'' version of quantum difference Toda equation, thus extending the results for g=S[(N)from Givental and Lee in 2003 and Braverman and Finkelberg in 2005; in view of the first part this also proves a conjecture from Givental and Lee in 2003 describing the quantum K-theory of Bg in terms of the Langlands dual quantum group Uq(ǧ) (for non-simply laced g certain modification of that conjecture is necessary). Similar analysis (modulo certain assumptions) is performed for affine g, extending the results of Braverman and Finkelberg. © Copyright 2014 American Mathematical Society.",,,,"American Mathematical Society",,,,,08940347,,,"English","J.

The author defines autonomy and articulates its three components - life goals and moral rules, affective and sensual demands, and social norms and expectations, and three levels of processing these components - awareness/mindfulness, reflectivity, and decision making. He states that sense of self, which function at two levels: a core experiential pre-reflective self and an autobiographical, narrative, and reflected self, constitutes the center of autonomous functioning of every human being. He uses arguments from developmental, social, and cultural psychology to validate his position that human autonomy is a culturally universal phenomenon. Autonomy requires for its development a socio-cultural environment, thus, everywhere where there are meaningful social interactions mediated by language it may emerge. The author also differentiates cultural models and ideologies of independent/individualistic versus interdependent/collectivistic selves from a first-person, perspectival self that initiates and regulates autonomous functioning and discusses the consequences of confusion between these understandings. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Our approach is biologically grounded in a theory of how the human visual system solves this problem, focusing on shapes that are mirror symmetrical in 3-D. A 3-D mirror-symmetrical shape can be recovered from a single 2-D orthographic or perspective image by applying several a priori constraints: 3-D mirror symmetry, 3-D compactness, and planarity of contours. From the computational point of view, the application of a 3-D symmetry constraint is challenging because it requires establishing 3-D symmetry correspondence among features of a 2-D image, which itself is asymmetrical for almost all viewing directions relative to the 3-D symmetrical shape. We describe new invariants of a 3-D to 2-D projection for the case of a pair of mirror-symmetrical planar contours, and we formally state and prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for detection of this type of symmetry in a single orthographic and perspective image. © 2014 IEEE.","3-D shape recovery; 3-D symmetry; 3-D symmetry correspondence; Perspective projection; skewed symmetry","Cameras; Computation theory; Recovery; Shape optimization; Video cameras; 3-D shape; 3-D symmetry correspondence; Human Visual System; Perspective image; Perspective projections; Standing problems; Symmetry constraints; Viewing directions; Mirrors",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,00189219,,IEEPA,"English","Proc.

We give different descriptions of the integrable tops and use them as building blocks for construction of more complicated integrable systems such as Gaudin models and classical spin chains (periodic and with boundaries). The known relation between the top and CM (or RS) models allows to rewrite the Gaudin models (or the spin chains) in the canonical variables. Then they assume the form of n-particle integrable systems with 2n constants. We also describe the generalization of the top to 1+1 field theories.

Our simulations of biophysical models show that the adaptation of pyramidal neurons coupled with their low firing rate leads to cluster formation.

While the effect of mixing on the evaluation of evoked responses and connectivity measures has been extensively studied, there are, to date, no studies reporting on the differences in the values of the estimated Hurst exponents when moving between sensor and source space representations of the multivariate data or on the effect of noise. Such differences, if not duly acknowledged, may lead to erroneous data interpretations. We show in simulations and in theory that measuring Hurst exponents in sensor space may lead to an incomplete picture of the LRTC properties of the underlying data and that noise may significantly bias the estimate of the Hurst exponent of the underlying signal. Moreover, these predictions are confirmed in real data, where we analyze the amplitude dynamics of neuronal oscillations in the resting state from EEG data. By moving either to an independent components representation or to a source representation which maximizes the signal to noise ratio in the alpha frequency range, we observe greater variance, skewness and kurtosis over measured Hurst exponents than in sensor space. We confirm the suitability of conventional source separation methodology by introducing a novel algorithm HeMax which obtains a source maximizing the Hurst exponent in the amplitude dynamics of narrow band oscillations. Our findings imply that the long-range correlative properties of the EEG should be studied in source space, in such a way that the SNR is maximized, or at least with spatial decomposition techniques approximating source activities, rather than in sensor space. © 2014.",,"algorithm; alpha rhythm; article; controlled study; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography phase synchronization; female; human; human experiment; Hurst exponent estimation; Hurst exponent maximization algorithm; Kurtosis; linear mixing effect; long range temporal correlation; male; mathematical phenomena; mu rhythm; nervous system potential; noise; normal human; occipital cortex; parietal cortex; prediction; prevalence; priority journal; process optimization; quantitative analysis; resting state network; sensor space; signal noise ratio; simulation; skewness; spatial spectral decomposition; statistical analysis; statistical bias; statistical concepts; statistical distribution; statistical model; statistical parameters; superimposed noise; time series analysis; validation process; volume conductor; algorithm; computer simulation; electroencephalography; magnetoencephalography; procedures; signal processing; statistical analysis; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Electroencephalography; Humans; Magnetoencephalography; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Young Adult",,"Academic Press Inc.",,,,,10538119,,NEIME,"English","NeuroImage",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903539106

Box 340, FI-00029 HUS, Finland","Background: The spatiotemporal coupling of brainwaves is commonly quantified using the amplitude or phase of signals measured by electro- or magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG). To enhance the temporal resolution for coupling delays down to millisecond level, a new power correlation (PC) method is proposed and tested. New method: The cross-correlations of any two brainwave powers at two locations are calculated sequentially through a measurement using the convolution theorem. For noise suppression, the cross-correlation series is moving-average filtered, preserving the millisecond resolution in the cross-correlations, but with reduced noise. The coupling delays are determined from the delays of the cross-correlation peaks. Results: Simulations showed that the new method detects reliably power cross-correlations with millisecond accuracy. Moreover, in MEG measurements on three healthy volunteers, the method showed average alpha-alpha coupling delays of around 0-20. ms between the occipital areas of two hemispheres. Lower-frequency brainwaves vs. alpha waves tended to have a larger lag; higher-frequency waves vs. alpha waves showed delays with large deviations. Comparison with existing methods: The use of signal power instead of its square root (amplitude) in the cross-correlations improves noise cancellation. Compared to signal phase, the signal power analysis time delays do not have periodic ambiguity. In addition, the novel method allows fast calculation of cross-correlations. Conclusions: The PC method conveys novel information about brainwave dynamics. The method may be extended from sensor-space to source-space analysis, and can be applied also for electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP). © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Brainwave; Coupling; MEG; Millisecond resolution; Power correlation","accuracy; alpha rhythm; article; electroencephalogram; frontal lobe; human; magnetoencephalography; measurement; noise reduction; normal human; occipital lobe; power analysis; priority journal; signal processing; simulation; time; algorithm; biological model; brain; computer simulation; electroencephalogram; magnetoencephalography; physiology; procedures; rest; signal processing; validation study; Algorithms; Alpha Rhythm; Brain; Brain Waves; Computer Simulation; Humans; Magnetoencephalography; Models, Neurological; Rest; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",,"Elsevier",,,,,01650270,,JNMED,"English","J.

While for Jacopo Zabarella, experience helps to confirm the results of demonstrative science, the Bologna Dominican Chrysostomo Javelli assumes that it also contributes to the discovery of new truths in what he calls 'beginning science'. Both thinkers use medical plants as a philosophical example. Javelli analyses the proposition 'rhubarb purges bile' as the conclusion of a yet unknown scientific proof. Zabarella uses instead hellebore, a plant that is found all over Europe, and defends the view that propositions about purgative powers of plants are based on their 'identity of substance', an identity that had become questionable with regard to rhubarb due to new empirical findings in the sixteenth century.","Chrysostomo Javelli; experience; Giovanni Manardi; Jacopo Zabarella; Jean Buridan; logic; medical plant; metaphysics; principle; rhubarb; Thomas Aquinas","chemistry; Helleborus; history; life event; medicinal plant; philosophy; Rheum; science; Helleborus; History, 15th Century; History, 16th Century; Life Change Events; Philosophy; Plants, Medicinal; Rheum; Science",,"Brill Academic Publishers",,,,,13837427,,,"English","Early Sci.

number of maternal deaths per 100 000 livebirths) between 1990 and 2015. We aimed to measure levels and track trends in maternal mortality, the key causes contributing to maternal death, and timing of maternal death with respect to delivery. Methods We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to analyse a database of data for 7065 site-years and estimate the number of maternal deaths from all causes in 188 countries between 1990 and 2013. We estimated the number of pregnancy-related deaths caused by HIV on the basis of a systematic review of the relative risk of dying during pregnancy for HIV-positive women compared with HIV-negative women. We also estimated the fraction of these deaths aggravated by pregnancy on the basis of a systematic review. To estimate the numbers of maternal deaths due to nine diff erent causes, we identified 61 sources from a systematic review and 943 site-years of vital registration data. We also did a systematic review of reports about the timing of maternal death, identifying 142 sources to use in our analysis. We developed estimates for each country for 1990-2013 using Bayesian meta-regression. We estimated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for all values. Findings 292 982 (95% UI 261 017-327 792) maternal deaths occurred in 2013, compared with 376 034 (343 483-407 574) in 1990. The global annual rate of change in the MMR was -0.3% (-1.1 to 0.6) from 1990 to 2003, and -2.7% (-3.9 to -1.5) from 2003 to 2013, with evidence of continued acceleration. MMRs reduced consistently in south, east, and southeast Asia between 1990 and 2013, but maternal deaths increased in much of sub-Saharan Africa during the 1990s. 2070 (1290-2866) maternal deaths were related to HIV in 2013, 0.4% (0.2-0.6) of the global total. MMR was highest in the oldest age groups in both 1990 and 2013. In 2013, most deaths occurred intrapartum or postpartum. Causes varied by region and between 1990 and 2013. We recorded substantial variation in the MMR by country in 2013, from 956.8 (685.1-1262.8) in South Sudan to 2.4 (1.6-3.6) in Iceland. Interpretation Global rates of change suggest that only 16 countries will achieve the MDG 5 target by 2015. Accelerated reductions since the Millennium Declaration in 2000 coincide with increased development assistance for maternal, newborn, and child health. Setting of targets and associated interventions for after 2015 will need careful consideration of regions that are making slow progress, such as west and central Africa.

Here, we investigated with three different neuroimaging modalities [magnetoencephalography (MEG), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and resting-state fMRI] whether spastic CP is associated with functional and anatomical abnormalities in the sensorimotor network. Ten children participated in the study: four with diplegic CP (DCP), three with hemiplegic CP (HCP), and three typically developing (TD) children. Somatosensory (SS)-evoked fields (SEFs) were recorded in response to pneumatic stimuli applied to digits D1, D3, and D5 of both hands. Several parameters of water diffusion were calculated from DTI between the thalamus and the pre-central and post-central gyri in both hemispheres. The sensorimotor resting-state networks (RSNs) were examined by using an independent component analysis method. Tactile stimulation of the fingers elicited the first prominent cortical response at ~50 ms, in all except one child, localized over the primary SS cortex (S1). In five CP children, abnormal somatotopic organization was observed in the affected (or more affected) hemisphere. Euclidean distances were markedly different between the two hemispheres in the HCP children, and between DCP and TD children for both hemispheres. DTI analysis revealed decreased fractional anisotropy and increased apparent diffusion coefficient for the thalamocortical pathways in the more affected compared to less affected hemisphere in CP children. Resting-state functional MRI results indicated absent and/or abnormal sensorimotor RSNs for children with HCP and DCP consistent with the severity and location of their lesions. Our findings suggest an abnormal SS processing mechanism in the sensorimotor network of children with CP possibly as a result of diminished thalamocortical projections. © 2014 Papadelis, Ahtam, Nazarova, Nimec, Snyder, Grant and Okada.","Cerebral palsy; Cortical reorganization; Magnetoencephalography; MR tractography; Resting-state functional MRI; Somatosensory processing","adolescent; Article; cerebral palsy; child; clinical article; diffusion coefficient; diffusion tensor imaging; disease association; event related potential; evoked somatosensory response; female; fractional anisotropy; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; magnetoencephalography; male; neuroimaging; postcentral gyrus; preschool child; primary motor cortex; primary somatosensory cortex; resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging; resting state network; school child; signal noise ratio; somatosensory cortex; stimulus response; tactile stimulation; thalamus",,"Frontiers Media S.

What is public and private in education is a political–social construct, subject to various political forces, primarily interpreted through the prism of the state. Mediated through the state, this construct can change over time as the economic and social context of higher education changes. In this paper, we analyze through the state’s financing of higher education how it changes as a public/private good and the forces that impinge on states to influence such changes. To illustrate our arguments, we discuss trends in higher education financing in the BRIC countries—Brazil, Russia, India, and China.

As a prototype hopping theory, we used the Gaussian disorder model while for representing the quasi-band theories we relied on the multiple trapping model, both of these for two types of the site/trap energy distributions. In case of the Gaussian distribution of trap depths, fitting procedure requires adjusting of the two model parameters (an energy distribution parameter σ and a frequency factor ν0). For an exponential distribution, a one-parameter (ν0) fitting suffices. The dipolar glass model, unlike the Gaussian disorder model, is basically different from the multiple trapping formalism, but a recently introduced two-layer multiple trapping model seems capable of reproducing TOF current shapes rather well. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

EDX mapping revealed the uniform elements distribution on the crystal surface while XRD measurements indicate that the crystals are compositionally inhomogeneous on the nanoscale. The physical properties of the as-prepared sample are characterized by electrical resistivity, magnetization and specific heat measurements. Resistivity measurements show the onset of the superconducting transition at 33 K and zero resistivity at 31.7 K. The large upper critical field Hc2(0) was estimated as high as about 140 T for the in-plane field and 38 T for the out-of-plane field.

We show that the resonance-induced renormalization of the QD energy spectrum, leading to the formation of the polaron-like states, can be performed exactly in terms of the arbitrarily degenerate states of electron-hole pairs and the phonon modes of equal energies. Using the model of QDs with finite potential barriers for electron and holes leads to new selection rules of interband optical transitions and the three-particle interaction describing simultaneous absorption and/or emission of a photon and a phonon. We also derive a simple expression for the differential cross section of the stationary, low-temperature photoluminescence, which allows the fundamental parameters of the polaron-like excitations to be readily extracted from the frequency-resolved experimental spectra. In particular, the energies of the excitations and the coherence relaxation rates of the optical transitions resulting in their generation and recombination are shown to be directly given by the positions and widths of the photoluminescence peaks.

Using this, we find that aggregate GDP growth is driven as much by capital input as MFP growth. Mining and Retailing industries are growing fast, but have poor MFP performance.

We observe changes in the ratio R of the mean amplitude of λ peaks at solar cycle minima with respect to peaks at solar maxima as a function of date, embedding dimension and, importantly, smoothing parameter N. We identify two distinct regimes, called Q1 and Q2, defined mainly by the evolution of R as a function of N: Q1, with increasing HSV behavior and R value as N is increased, occurs before 1915-1930; and Q2, with decreasing HSV behavior and R value as N is increased, occurs after ∼1975. We attempt to account for these observations with an autoregressive (order 1) model with Poissonian noise and a mean modulated by two sine waves of periods T<inf>1</inf> and T<inf>2</inf> (T<inf>1</inf> = 11 years, and intermediate T<inf>2</inf> is tuned to mimic quasibiennial oscillations QBO). The model can generate both Q1 and Q2 regimes. When m= 1, HSV appears in the absence of T<inf>2</inf> variations. When m= 2, Q1 occurs when T<inf>2</inf> variations are present, whereas Q2 occurs when T <inf>2</inf> variations are suppressed. We propose that the HSV behavior of the irregularity index of ISSN may be linked to the presence of strong QBO before 1915-1930, a transition and their disappearance around 1975, corresponding to a change in regime of solar activity. © Author(s) 2014.",,"amplitude; numerical model; Poisson ratio; solar activity; sunspot; Simplexvirus",,,,,,,10235809,,,"English","Nonlinear Processes Geophys.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921481244

On the other hand, cross-frequency communications are more flexible allowing interactions between oscillations with different frequencies. Among such cross-frequency interactions amplitude-to-amplitude interactions are of a special interest as they show how the strength of spatial synchronization in different neuronal populations relates to each other during a given task. While, previously, amplitude-to-amplitude correlations were studied primarily on the sensor level, we present a source separation approach using spatial filters which maximize the correlation between the envelopes of brain oscillations recorded with electro-/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) or intracranial multichannel recordings. Our approach, which is called canonical source power correlation analysis (cSPoC), is thereby capable of extracting genuine brain oscillations solely based on their assumed coupling behavior even when the signal-to-noise ratio of the signals is low. In addition to using cSPoC for the analysis of cross-frequency interactions in the same subject, we show that it can also be utilized for studying amplitude dynamics of neuronal oscillations across subjects. We assess the performance of cSPoC in simulations as well as in three distinctively different analysis scenarios of real EEG data, each involving several subjects. In the simulations, cSPoC outperforms unsupervised state-of-the-art approaches. In the analysis of real EEG recordings, we demonstrate excellent unsupervised discovery of meaningful power-to-power couplings, within as well as across subjects and frequency bands. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Cross-frequency coupling; CSPoC; ECoG; EEG; LFP; MEG; Neural oscillations; Power-to-power coupling; SPoC","action potential; article; brain computer interface; brain electrophysiology; brain oscillation; canonical source power correlation analysis; correlation analysis; electrocorticography; electroencephalography; female; human; human experiment; local field potential; magnetoencephalography; male; multichannel recorder; nervous system parameters; neuroimaging; normal human; priority journal; signal noise ratio; stimulus response; algorithm; biological rhythm; brain; brain mapping; computer assisted diagnosis; electroencephalogram; image enhancement; nerve cell network; oscillometry; physiology; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; statistical analysis; Algorithms; Biological Clocks; Brain; Brain Mapping; Brain Waves; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetoencephalography; Nerve Net; Oscillometry; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",,"Academic Press Inc.",,,,,10538119,,NEIME,"English","NeuroImage",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901068817

While up till that time the focus had been primarily on very general issues (such as the mean intelligence of cultural populations or ethnocultural groups), research began to move away from such general issues in order to discern relationships between specific features of cognitive development and performance, and specific features of and experiences in particular cultures. While some of these broad generalizations have continued, research became more contextualized, and focused on the particular features of individuals' home, school, or neighborhood experiences, and how these features impact their cognitive development and performance. In this chapter, some basic frameworks from the field of cross-cultural psychology are employed to examine the research on the relationship between culture and cognition. These are the universalist perspective on cognition in cultural context, and the ecocultural framework, which seeks to understand the cognitive adaptation and development of persons living in particular habitats. The combination of these two perspectives provides a basis for examining both the underlying similarities in cognitive processes and the cultural variation in cognitive development (competence) and display (performance). Some conclusions are drawn from this overview: conceptions of cognitive abilities are now less ethnocentric; assessments are now more culturally appropriate; and interpretations and applications of the findings are now more in tune with the needs of people in the societies in which research is being carried out. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, the regime mounted a very visible prosecution against the three young women. We argue that the trial marked a shift in the Kremlin's strategy to shape state-society relations. In the face of declining economic conditions and social unrest, the PR trial encapsulated the Kremlin's renewed focus on three related mechanisms to insure social support: coercion, alliance building, and symbolic politics.

The establishment of new centres of domination and collectivization was accompanied by a major shift in the official attitude towards the indigenous population of the region, and by the depreciation of their role in the exploitation of natural resources. The reconfiguration of spaces was carried out by means of repressive measures and produced major grievances and resistance among the indigenous population. The Second World War further aggravated the situation. The incorporation of Chukotka into the Soviet state resulted in the disruption of indigenous economies and a major decline in population.

At the end of the 20th century, a higher demand for flexible labour relations was accompanied by a value shift towards the expansion of individual freedom, tolerance, and creativity. As previous research shows, non-permanent jobs often bring losses in wages, income instability, uncertainty about the future, and job dissatisfaction. This leads us to expect that flexible working relations could contribute to unhappiness and life dissatisfaction. We use the European Social Survey (2010) as an empirical basis for the analysis. The main tested idea of the paper is that countries with more liberal labour legislation have higher rates of subjective well-being as fewer people are employed on a temporary basis. The results from the regression analysis show that temporary and informal employment negatively affects subjective well-being, whereas self-employment influences subjective well-being positively. Strict employment protection legislation has negative impact on subjective well-being, especially for informal workers and temporary contractors. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Cliques and independent sets of the market graph give an information about concentrated dependent sets of stocks and distributed independent sets of stocks on the market. In the present paper the connections between market graph and classical Markowitz portfolio theory are studied. In particular, efficient frontiers of cliques and independent sets of the market graph are compared with the efficient frontier of the market. The main result is: efficient frontier of the market can be well approximated by the efficient frontier of the maximum independent set of the market graph constructed on the sets of stocks with the highest Sharp ratio. This allows to reduce the number of stocks for portfolio optimization without the loss of quality of obtained portfolios. In addition it is shown that cliques of the market graphs are not suitable for portfolio optimization. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

The solution is found using a hodograph-type transform, which extends the well-known Carrier-Greenspan transform for wave run-up on a plane beach. As a result, the nonlinear shallow water equations are reduced to a single one-dimensional linear wave equation for an auxiliary function and all physical variables can be expressed in terms of this function by purely algebraic formulas. In the special case of a U-shaped channel this equation coincides with a spherically symmetric wave equation in space, whose dimension is defined by the channel cross-section and can be fractional. As an example, the run-up of a sinusoidal wave on a beach is considered for channels of several different cross-sections and the influence of the cross-section on wave run-up characteristics is studied. © 2014 Cambridge University Press.","coastal engineering; solitary waves; surface gravity waves","Beaches; Coastal engineering; Equations of motion; Gravity waves; Solitons; Wave equations; Arbitrary cross section; Auxiliary functions; Channel cross section; Exact analytical solutions; Non-linear shallow water equations; Nonlinear shallow water; One-dimensional linear wave equations; Surface gravity waves; Nonlinear equations; coastal engineering; gravity wave; nonlinear wave; solitary wave; wave equation; wave runup",,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,00221120,,JFLSA,"English","J.

Badiou claims that Hegel illegitimately attempts to impose a distinction that is only relevant to the qualitative realm onto the quantitative realm. He suggests that Cantor’s mathematical account of infinite multiplicities that are determinate and actual remains an endlessly proliferating bad infinite when placed within Hegel’s faulty schema. In contrast, Priest affirms the Hegelian true infinite, claiming that Cantor’s formal mechanisms of boundary transcendence, such as ‘diagonalization’, are implicit in Hegel’s dialectic. While arguing that a clear dividing line can be drawn here between these two interpretations of the relationship between Hegel and Cantor, this paper also mounts a defence of the Hegelian true infinite by developing Priest’s suggestion that Cantorian diagonalizing functions are prefigured by Hegel’s dialectical overcoming of limits. © 2014 Taylor & Francis, all rights reserved.","Badiou; Cantor; Graham Priest; Hegel; Infinity; Set theory",,,"Routledge",,,,,09672559,,,"English","Int.

Many physical channels can be formally described as quantum Gaussian operations acting on bosonic quantum states. Depending on the input state and on the quality of the channel, the output suffers certain amount of noise. For a long time it has been conjectured, but never proved, that output states of Gaussian channels corresponding to coherent input signals are the less noisy ones (in the sense of a majorization criterion). Here we prove this conjecture. Specifically we show that every output state of a phase-insensitive Gaussian channel is majorized by the output state corresponding to a coherent input. The proof is based on the optimality of coherent states for the minimization of strictly concave output functionals. Moreover we show that coherent states are the unique optimizers. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Using panel regression analysis to look at the determinants of increasing state involvement, this article shows that election results for the ruling president and his party, as well as the degree to which elections are manipulated throughout Russia's regions, are significantly and positively correlated with the number of raids in a given region, while regions with governors that have stronger local ties are characterized by a smaller number of attacks. A potential interpretation of these findings is that the federal center may tolerate a certain degree of predatory activities by regional elites, as long as these elites are able to deliver a sufficiently high level of electoral support for the center, with the effect being weaker in regions where the governor is interested in the long-term development of the regional economy. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.","authoritarian electoral regimes; corporate raiding; property rights; state predation; stationary and roving bandits","corporate strategy; data set; electoral system; panel data; property rights; regional economy; regression analysis; state role; Russian Federation",,"Bellwether Publishing, Ltd.",,,,,1060586X,,,"English","Post-Sov.

The informal ties have a strong impact on trial outcome, which, however, changes over time. During periods of high bureaucratic risks and uncertainty, regions with a higher extent of informal ties between judges and prosecutors exhibit more repressive law enforcement. If external risks decrease, informal coalitions seem to increase the independence of the courts, insulating them from bureaucratic pressures and limiting their repressiveness. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.","court repressiveness; fraud convictions; informal ties; judges; prosecutors; Russian criminal courts","bureaucracy; law enforcement; social justice; uncertainty analysis; Russian Federation",,"Bellwether Publishing, Ltd.",,,,,1060586X,,,"English","Post-Sov.

We show that a viscoelastic solution of entangled micellar chains is extremely responsive to hydrocarbons-the addition of only 0.5 wt % n-dodecane results in a drastic drop in viscosity by up to 5 orders of magnitude, which is due to the complete disruption of micelles and the formation of microemulsion droplets. We study the whole range of the transition of wormlike micelles into microemulsion droplets and discover that it can be divided into three regions: (i) in the first region, the solutions retain a high viscosity (∼10-350 Pa·s), the micelles are entangled but their length is reduced by the solubilization of hydrocarbons; (ii) in the second region, the system transitions to the unentangled regime and the viscosity sharply decreases as a result of further micelle shortening and the appearance of microemulsion droplets; (iii) in the third region, the viscosity is low (∼0.001 Pa·s) and only microemulsion droplets remain in the solution. The experimental studies were accompanied by theoretical considerations, which allowed us to reveal for the first time that (i) one of the leading mechanisms of micelle shortening is the preferential accumulation of the solubilized hydrocarbon in the spherical end caps of wormlike micelles, which makes the end caps thermodynamically more favorable; (ii) the onset of the sharp drop in viscosity is correlated with the crossover from the entangled to unentangled regime of the wormlike micellar solution taking place upon the shortening of micellar chains; and (iii) in the unentangled regime short cylindrical micelles coexist with microemulsion droplets. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Chains; Drops; Hydrocarbons; Microemulsions; Viscoelasticity; Viscosity; Cylindrical micelles; High viscosities; Orders of magnitude; Potassium oleate; Rheological property; System transitions; Worm-like micelles; Wormlike micellar solutions; Micelles",,"American Chemical Society",,,,,07437463,,LANGD,"English","Langmuir",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897973624

However, these studies have predominantly examined national events. The aim of this study is to provide a statistical evaluation of the relationship between mass gatherings in some relatively small urban sub-populations and the general suicide rates of a major city. Methods. The data were gathered in the Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk, with a population of 1 million people, in 2005-2010. Suicide attempts, suicides, and the total amount of suicide-related behaviours were registered daily for each sex. Bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis, including negative binomial regression, were applied to assess the risk of suicide-related behaviour in the city's general population for 7 days before and after 427 mass gatherings, such as concerts, football games, and non-regular mass events organized by the Orthodox Church and new religious movements. Results: The bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses found significant changes in some suicide-related behaviour rates in the city's population after certain kinds of mass gatherings. In particular, we observed an increased relative risk (RR) of male suicide-related behaviour after a home defeat of the local football team (RR = 1.32, p = 0.047; regression coefficient beta = 0.371, p = 0.002), and an increased risk of male suicides (RR = 1.29, p = 0.006; beta =0.255, p = 0.002), male suicide-related behaviour (RR = 1.25, p = 0.019; beta =0.251, p < 0.001), and total suicide-related behaviour (RR = 1.23 p < 0.001; beta =0.187, p < 0.001) after events organized by the new religious movements. Conclusions: Although football games and mass events organized by new religious movements involved a relatively small part of an urban population (1.6 and 0.3%, respectively), we observed a significant increase of the some suicide-related behaviour rates in the whole population. It is likely that the observed effect on suicide-related behaviour is related to one's personal presence at the event rather than to its broadcast. Our findings can be explained largely in terms of Gabennesch's theory of the 'broken-promises effect' with regard to intra- and interpersonal conflict and, in terms of crowd behaviour effects. © 2014 Usenko et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Broken-promises effect; Concerts; Conflict; Crowd behaviour; Football; Mass gatherings; New religious movements; Religion; Suicide; Suicide attempt","crowding (area); female; football; human; male; mass behavior; regression analysis; religion; risk factor; soccer; social behavior; suicidal ideation; suicide; suicide attempt; Ukraine; urban population; violence; Crowding; Female; Football; Humans; Male; Mass Behavior; Regression Analysis; Religion; Risk Factors; Soccer; Social Behavior; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide; Suicide, Attempted; Ukraine; Urban Population; Violence",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",,,,,14712458,,,"English","BMC Public Health",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899587387

Measurements have been performed at a temperature of 4.2 K, and magnetic fields up to 250 mT have been applied perpendicularly to the meander plane. While photon count rates are field independent at weak applied fields, they show a strong dependence at fields starting from approximately ±25 mT. This behavior, as well as the magnetic field dependence of the dark count rates, is in good agreement with the recent theoretical model of vortex-assisted photon detection and spontaneous vortex crossing in narrow superconducting lines. However, the local reduction of the superconducting free energy due to photon absorption, which is the fitting parameter in the model, increases much slower with the photon energy than the model predicts. Furthermore, changes in the free-energy during photon counts and dark counts depend differently on the current that flows through the meander.

The main effects are the unusual TOF (surface generation) current rise in the preflight region (be it a flat plateau or a cusp) due to the accumulated space charge and the current reduction at all times because of the monomolecular recombination. TOF-2 (bulk generation) transients are less sensitive to charged centers. Analysis of these effects has proved that charged centers do not change the carrier mobility provided that the space charge field and bimolecular recombination are properly accounted for in terms of the proposed two-layer MT model. We have shown that combination of TOF, TOF-1a and TOF-2 variants of the electron-gun based technique allows one to establish definitively the character of the charge carrier transport in MDPs. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The σ-algebra B is assumed to be countably generated. It is proved that if the chain is aperiodic and function f and measure ν are small, then [ν(Pnf)]1/n → R as n → ∞, where R is the convergence parameter. For periodic Markov chains this statement can be modified in the following way. If a chain X is symmetric with respect to some σ-finite measure π, then R = ∥P ∥-1, where P̃ is a bounded self-adjoint operator generated by P and acting in the space L2(π).

The paper looks at this process at a Russian university (National Research University Higher School of Economics - HSE) where the system is being implemented and examines the following issues: qualification and readiness of the stakeholders to use LMS and their perceptions of the system's convenience, effectiveness, and usefulness. The research reveals remarkable divergence of students' and teachers' perceptions of various aspects of LMS which must be considered when raising the effectiveness of the system and building commitment to e-learning.

The chosen method, multilevel multinomial logistic regression, allows, first, distinguishing among voting for several party families as well as abstention and, second, controlling for differences between countries and survey rounds. I find that the radical right electorate is not characterized by social alienation or anti-modern values; these characteristics are more likely to be encountered among people who abstain from elections. Radical right voting is most strongly motivated by political attitudes, namely by negative perception of immigration, political mistrust, opposition to income redistribution, and - rather unexpectedly - political satisfaction. My analysis also shows that radical right parties in different West European countries attract voters with similar ideological orientations which remain relatively stable over time. In the conclusion I discuss the implications of my findings for comparative research on the radical right party family. © The Author(s) 2013.","abstention; radical right; voting behavior; Western Europe",,,,,,,,13540688,,PAPOF,"English","Party Polit.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894648546

However, little of the variation in the dependent variables can be explained by variation in family resources. In Tatarstan, as in developed countries, family resources have a low influence on educational outcomes. Moreover, school quality, gender, nationality, peers, health, plans about future work, and other physical and psychological factors play important roles in influencing educational outcomes.

The authors come up with this problem since believe that the new economy conditions require an adjustment and a development of classical firm theory. Design/methodology/approach: The research question addressed in this study is mainly related to the empirical validation of the function based on companies' intangibles in the Cobb-Douglas framework. This model enables the authors to advocate the idea of the complementarity of intellectual resources as well as simplifies the analysis of intellectual capital features. To accomplish the purpose of the research, the authors design a log-linear model and estimate it on a sample of more than 400 European and American companies. Findings: Application of Cobb-Douglas framework allowed designing a production function based on intellectual capital. The complementarity of intellectual capital components is justified on the empirical results obtained in this research. The increasing return to scale for intellectual capital was established for the sample examined in this study. Research limitations/implications: The main shortcoming of the approach implemented in this study is related to the proxy indicators of intellectual capital. Nevertheless, the authors statistically validate the chosen indicators applying hedonic approach. Practical implications: Practical accomplishment of this research is mainly associated with the conclusion about an increasing return to scale of intellectual capital. This phenomenon appears to be of a particular importance for investment decisions. Originality/value: The findings of this paper provide a new insight into intellectual resources interrelation that enhances companies' value creation. The authors also hope to assist future research attempts in application of the theory of company's growth driven by its intangible capital. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cobb-Douglas; Complementarity of intellectual resources; Intangibles; Intellectual capital; Production function; Returns to scale",,,,,,,,01443585,,,"English","J.

Here we use magnetoencephalography, supported by a masked priming behavioral study, to address these questions using contrasting sets of simple (walk), complex (swimmer), and pseudo-complex (corner) forms. Early analyses of orthographic structure, detectable in bilateral posterior temporal regions within a 150-230msec time frame, are shown to segment the visual input into linguistic substrings (words and morphemes) that trigger lexical access in left middle temporal locations from 300 msec. These are primarily feedforward processes and are not initially constrained by lexical-level variables. Lexical constraints become significant from 390 msec, in both simple and complex words, with increased processing of pseudowords and pseudo-complex forms. These results, consistent with morpho-orthographic models based on masked priming data, map out the real-time functional architecture of visual word recognition, establishing basic feedforward processing relationships between orthographic form, morphological structure, and lexical meaning. © 2014 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"adult; Article; consonant; female; human; human experiment; magnetoencephalography; male; normal human; pars opercularis; pars triangularis; stimulus response; task performance; temporal lobe; word recognition; adolescent; brain; brain mapping; linguistics; nerve tract; pattern recognition; photostimulation; physiology; reading; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Female; Humans; Linguistics; Magnetoencephalography; Male; Neural Pathways; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation; Reading; Young Adult",,"MIT Press Journals",,,,,0898929X,,JCONE,"English","J.

Although recent evidence emphasizes the fundamental role of prior knowledge for perceptual decision making, only few studies have quantified the relevance of such priors on perceptual decisions and examined their interplay with other decision-relevant factors, such as the stimulus properties. In the present study we asked whether hysteresis, describing the stability of a percept despite a change in stimulus property and known to occur at perceptual thresholds, also acts as a form of an implicit prior in tactile spatial decision making, supporting the stability of a decision across successively presented random stimuli (i.e., decision hysteresis). We applied a variant of the classical 2-point discrimination task and found that hysteresis influenced perceptual decision making: Participants were more likely to decide 'same' rather than 'different' on successively presented pin distances. In a direct comparison between the influence of applied pin distances (explicit stimulus property) and hysteresis, we found that on average, stimulus property explained significantly more variance of participants' decisions than hysteresis. However, when focusing on pin distances at threshold, we found a trend for hysteresis to explain more variance. Furthermore, the less variance was explained by the pin distance on a given decision, the more variance was explained by hysteresis, and vice versa. Our findings suggest that hysteresis acts as an implicit prior in tactile spatial decision making that becomes increasingly important when explicit stimulus properties provide decreasing evidence. © 2014 Thiel et al.",,"adult; article; controlled study; decision making; depth perception; female; human; human experiment; hysteresis; male; mental capacity; mental task; normal human; perceptive discrimination; perceptive threshold; sensory stimulation; tactile spatial decision making; task performance; variance; decision making; physiology; psychological model; psychometry; questionnaire; touch; Adult; Decision Making; Discrimination (Psychology); Female; Humans; Male; Models, Psychological; Psychometrics; Sensory Thresholds; Space Perception; Surveys and Questionnaires; Touch Perception",,"Public Library of Science",,,,,19326203,,POLNC,"English","PLoS ONE",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896368360

The Wnt signaling pathway is of the immediate therapeutic relevance, as it plays critical roles in cancer development and progression. However, drugs which disrupt this pathway are unavailable despite the high demand. Here we report an attempt to identify antagonists of the Wnt-FZD interaction among the library of the FDA-approved drugs. We performed an in silico screening which brought up several potential antagonists of the ligand-receptor interaction. 14 of these substances were tested using the TopFlash luciferase reporter assay and four of them identified as active and specific inhibitors of the Wnt3a-induced signaling. However, further analysis through GTP-binding and β-catenin stabilization assays showed that the compounds do not target the Wnt-FZD pair, but inhibit the signaling at downstream levels. We further describe the previously unknown inhibitory activity of an anti-leprosy drug clofazimine in the Wnt pathway and provide data demonstrating its efficiency in suppressing growth of Wnt-dependent triple-negative breast cancer cells. These data provide a basis for further investigations of the efficiency of clofazimine in treatment of Wnt-dependent cancers. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Breast cancer; Clofazimine; In silico screening; Wnt signaling","Breast cancer; Clofazimine; In silico screening; Wnt signaling; Animals; Binding Sites; Cell Line, Tumor; Clofazimine; Crystallography, X-Ray; Growth Inhibitors; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Leprostatic Agents; Mice; Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Wnt3A Protein",,,,,,,00062952,,BCPCA,"English","Biochem.

Utilizing bivariate DCC-GARCH modeling, we estimate volatility spillover effects and dynamic conditional correlation between equity markets in South and North America, the US and European markets. Our results show that the US market (S&P500 index) is the main volatility transmitter worldwide, whereas the UK, German and French markets are the sources of volatility for the European developed and emerging European equity markets. However, the German DAX index, contrary to some studies, cannot be considered as dominant in the European region, in spite of the leadership of the German economy. According to the results of our study the role of volatility transmitter belongs to the UK stock market. More importantly, we find that the influence of Russian market volatility exceeds the influence of Poland in the Eastern and Northern European regions, closely tracking their levels of market capitalization. © IDOSI Publications, 2014.","Bivariate DCC-GARCH model; International equity markets; Time-varying correlation; Volatility spillover effects",,,,,,,,18184952,,,"English","World Appl.

This claim is based on a finding that observers are good at representing the average when an ensemble includes only two sizes distributed among all items (regular sets), but their performance gets worse when the number of sizes increases with the number of items (irregular sets). We argue that an important factor not considered by Marchant et al. (2013) is the range of size variation that was much bigger in their irregular sets. We manipulated this factor across our experiments and found almost the same efficiency of averaging for both regular and irregular sets when the range was stabilized. Moreover, highly regular sets consisting only of small and large items (two-peaks distributions) were averaged with greater error than sets with small, large, and intermediate items, suggesting a segmentation threshold determining whether all variable items are perceived as a single ensemble or distinct subsets.

In this class of models, costly revisits do make a substantive difference and their impact can be of the same order of magnitude as the initial search cost.

We also show that for arbitrary prior distributions, the insider's trading strategy is uniquely determined by a Doob h-transform that expresses the insider's informational advantage.

The model agents of two types are introduced: mass (rational) and individual (scenario) agents. The former type includes Bank, Producer, Household, Owner, and Trader. The latter type includes State, Central Bank, Exporter, and Importer. The model is reduced to a boundary-value problem for a significantly nonlinear system of equations. These equations are derived from the initial hypothesis by means of the original economic modelling assistance system ECOMOD which is developed in the computer algebra system MAPLE. The model is adjusted with respect to official statistical quarterly data from 2004 till 2010. The calculation results are provided.

On one hand, reducing the backbone size will reduce the maintenance overhead. So how to minimize the CDS size is a critical issue. On the other hand, when evaluating the performance of a wireless network, the hop distance between two communication nodes, which reflect the energy consumption and response delay, is of great importance. Hence how to minimize the routing cost is also a key problem for constructing the network virtual backbone. In this paper, we study the problem of constructing applicable CDS in wireless networks in terms of size and routing cost. We formulate a wireless network as a Disk-Containment Graph (DCG), which is a generalization of the Unit-Disk Graph (UDG), and we develop an efficient algorithm to construct CDS in such kind of graphs. The algorithm contains two parts and is flexible to balance the performance between the two metrics. We also analyze the algorithm theoretically. It is shown that our algorithm has provable performance in minimizing the CDS size and reducing the communication distance for routing. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Approximation algorithm; CDS; Routing efficiency; Wireless network","CdS; Communication distance; Communication nodes; Connected Dominating Set; Maintenance overhead; Routing efficiency; Unit disk graphs; Virtual backbone; Approximation algorithms; Energy utilization; Telecommunication networks; Wireless networks",,,,,,,18624472,,,"English","Optim.

The main term of an asymptotic solution at an arbitrary finite time is a sum of Gaussian packets and generalized Gaussian packets (localized near a certain set of codimension one).We study the number of packets as time tends to infinity.

Several methods may be used to decompose the data into a set of spatial components with temporal loadings. Component selection is of crucial importance, and should be supported by objective criteria. In some applications, the use of a well defined component selection criterion may provide for automation of the analysis. In this paper we describe a novel approach for ranking of spatial components calculated from the EEG or MEG data recorded within evoked response paradigm. Our method is called Mutual Information (MI) Spectrum and is based on gauging the amount of MI of spatial component temporal loadings with a synthetically created reference signal. We also describe the appropriate randomization based statistical assessment scheme that can be used for selection of components with statistically significant amount of MI. Using simulated data with realistic trial to trial variations and SNR corresponding to the real recordings we demonstrate the superior performance characteristics of the described MI based measure as compared to a more conventionally used power driven gauge. We also demonstrate the application of the MI Spectrum for the selection of task-related independent components from real MEG data. We show that the MI spectrum allows to identify task-related components reliably in a consistent fashion, yielding stable results even from a small number of trials. We conclude that the proposed method fits naturally the information driven nature of ICA and can be used for routine and automatic ranking of independent components calculated from the functional neuroimaging data collected within event-related paradigms. © 2014 Ossadtchi, Pronko, Baillet, Pflieger and Stroganova.","Components selection; Eloquent cortex mapping; ICA; Mutual information; Spatial components; SVD","article; brain mapping; electroencephalography; functional neuroimaging; independent component analysis; mathematical model; motor cortex; simulation; spatial analysis; statistical analysis",,,,,,,16625196,,,"English","Front.

This study performs a broad review of technical, economic, environmental and supply chain issues related to coalto- liquids (CTL) and gas-to-liquids (GTL). We find three issues predominate. First, significant amounts of coal and gas would be required to obtain anything more than a marginal production of liquids. Second, the economics of CTL plants are clearly prohibitive, but are better for GTL. Nevertheless, large-scale GTL plants still require very high upfront costs, and for three real-world GTL plants out of four, the final cost has been so far approximately three times that initially budgeted. Small-scale GTL holds potential for associated gas. Third, both CTL and GTL incur significant environmental impacts, ranging from increased greenhouse gas emissions (in the case of CTL) to water contamination.

The authors demonstrate how regime responses to these dilemmas - typically efforts to maintain control while avoiding outright repression and societal backlash - have negative outcomes, including a weakening of formal institutions, proliferation of ""substitutions"" (e.g., substitutes for institutions), and increasing centralization and personalization of control. Efforts by Russian leaders to disengage society from the sphere of decision-making entail a significant risk of systemic breakdown in unexpected ways. More specifically, given significantly weakened institutions for interest representation and negotiated compromise, policy-making in the Russian system often amounts to the leadership's best guess (ad hoc manual policy adjustments) as to precisely what society will accept and what it will not, with a significant possibility of miscalculation.

Based on the calculations performed using open databases of governmental authorities, a classification of regions by teacher pay levels was developed, providing seven clusters of regions. For each of the clusters, we have elaborated recommendations on teacher remuneration, identifying typical risks and challenges. These recommendations are designed to improve efficiency of activities that are part of the education policy by way of differentiating federal assistance. The conclusion is that, apart from the index of teacher pay level as compared to the average regional salary, which is the benchmark of governmental programs, one should also consider the ratios of salary to the average consumer basket and to the per capita gross regional product.","Economics of education; General education; Labor market; Regional education policy; Salary; Social status; Teachers",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

This task is formulated in terms of computer vision approach as a moving object detection in noisy environment. It is shown that the state-of-the-art local descriptors (SURF, SIFT, FAST, ORB) are not characterized with satisfactory detection quality if the camera resolution is low, the lighting is changed dramatically and shadows are observed. In this paper we propose to use a simple mathematical morphological algorithm to detect the presence of a cargo on the forklift truck. Its first step is the estimation of the movement direction and the front part of the truck by using the updating motion history image. The second step is the application of Canny contour detection and binary morphological operations in front of the moving object to estimate simple geometric features of empty forklift. The algorithm is implemented with the OpenCV library. Our experimental study shows that the best results are achieved if the difference of the width of bounding rectangles is used as a feature. Namely, the detection accuracy is 78.7 % (compare with 40 % achieved by the best local descriptor), while the average frame processing time is only 5 ms (compare with 35 ms for the fastest descriptor). © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Binary morphology; Canny operator; Forklifttruck detection; Motion history image; Noisy environment; Object detection; SURF; Video-based recognition","Algorithms; Computer vision; Estimation; Materials handling equipment; Motion estimation; Object recognition; Trucks; Binary morphology; Canny Operators; Motion history images; Noisy environment; Object Detection; SURF; Video-based recognition; Mathematical morphology",,"Springer Verlag",,,,,18650929,,,"English","Commun.

While there is substantial literature devoted to disproving AIDS-denialist views, there is a lack of studies exploring AIDS-denialists online communities that interact with an external environment. Objective: We explored three research areas: (1) reasons for newcomers to come to an AIDS-denialist community, (2) the patterns of interactions of the community with the newcomers, and (3) rhetorical strategies that denialists use for persuasion in the veracity of their views. Methods: We studied the largest AIDS-denialist community on one of the most popular social networking services in Russia. We used netnography as a method for collecting data for qualitative analysis and observed the community for 9 months (at least 2-3 times a week). While doing netnography, we periodically downloaded community discussions. In total, we downloaded 4821 posts and comments for analysis. Grounded theory approach was used for data analysis. Results: Most users came to the community for the following reasons: their stories did not fit the unitary picture of AIDS disease progression translated by popular medical discourse, health problems, concern about HIV-positive tests, and desire to dissuade community members from false AIDS beliefs. On the basis of strength in AIDS-denialist beliefs, we constructed a typology of the newcomers consisting of three ideal-typical groups: (1) convinced: those who already had become denialists before coming to the group, (2) doubters: those who were undecided about the truth of either human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) science theory or AIDS-denialist theory, and (3) orthodox: those who openly held HIV science views. Reception of a newcomer mainly depended on the newcomer's belief status. Reception was very warm for the convinced, cold or slightly hostile for the doubters, and extremely hostile or derisive for the orthodox. We identified seven main rhetorical strategies of persuasion used by the denialists on the ""undecided"". Conclusions: Contrary to the widespread public health depiction of AIDS denialists as totally irrational, our study suggests that some of those who become AIDS denialists have sufficiently reasonable grounds to suspect that ""something is wrong"" with scientific theory, because their personal experience contradicts the unitary picture of AIDS disease progression. Odd and inexplicable practices of some AIDS centers only fuel these people's suspicions. We can conclude that public health practitioners' practices may play a role in generating AIDS-denialist sentiments. In interactions with the newcomers, the experienced community members highlighted the importance of personal autonomy and freedom of choice in decision making consistent with the consumerist ideology of health care. The study findings suggest that health care workers should change a one-size-fits-all mode of counseling for a more complex and patient-tailored approach, allowing for diversity of disease progression scenarios and scientific uncertainty. ©Peter Meylakhs, Yuri Rykov, Olessia Koltsova, Sergey Koltsov.","Aids denialists; Consumer health information; Internet; Netnography; Online communities; Qualitative research; Quality of health information on the internet","acquired immune deficiency syndrome; consumer health information; denial; human; information seeking; persuasive communication; psychology; Russian Federation; social media; social network; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Consumer Health Information; Denial (Psychology); Humans; Information Seeking Behavior; Persuasive Communication; Russia; Social Media; Social Networking",,"Journal of Medical Internet Research",,,,,14388871,,,"English","J.

The first section explicates my conception of culture - a conception of the normative value system that underlies social practices and institutions. I then derive seven value orientations that are useful for describing and comparing societies. Next, the chapter discusses the conceptual underpinnings for measuring the cultural value orientations. It then presents the survey methods developed for this purpose, and the empirical validation of the content of the value orientations and of the structure of relations among them. This is based on analyses of data across 77 national groups in 75 countries. Brief comparisons of these value orientations with two other dimensional approaches to culture are followed by an analysis that justifies treating countries as cultural units. The middle section of the chapter uses the seven validated cultural orientations to generate a worldwide graphic mapping of national cultures. This map permits comparison of national cultures with one another on each orientation. It reveals eight distinct world cultural regions that reflect the influence of geographic proximity, history, language, and other factors. To illustrate the meaningfulness of the cultural map, I discuss the distinctive cultural profiles of each world cultural region. The final third of the chapter examines associations between culture, measured by the value orientations, and a variety of variables of economic significance: the socioeconomic level of countries, their level of corruption, the social net they provide to citizens, their level of democracy, and the competitiveness of their market systems. It discusses the reciprocal causal processes that may account for these associations. Finally, the chapter analyzes how distance between countries on cultural value orientations affects the flow of investment around the world. The current approach differs from well-known theories of cultural dimensions (e.g. Inglehart and Baker, 2000; Hofstede, 2001) in deriving the constructs to measure culture from a priori theorizing and then testing the fit of these constructs to empirical data. Moreover, whereas other approaches seek orthogonal dimensions, I assume that correlated dimensions capture culture better because they can express the interdependence of cultural elements. My theory of culture specifies a coherent, integrated system of relations among the seven cultural orientations. These orientations form three correlated bipolar dimensions. Empirical measures of the seven orientations support the coherence of culture by revealing that the cultural profiles of societies rarely exhibit incompatible value emphases. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Cultural value orientations; Implications of national cultures for economics; Mapping 75 national cultures",,,,,,,,15740676,,,"English","Handb.

It is demonstrated that these complex psychological phenomena can be imitated by very simple means. At the heart of the emotional component of the robot's architecture is Simonov's Information Theory of Emotions. The main assumption of this theory is that emotions represent the brain's estimate of any actual need of the individual together with the probability of its satisfaction. The temperamental component of the model controls the balance of excitation and inhibition within the robot's cognitive architecture. Experiments were conducted with a couple of simple mobile autonomous robots. Experimental results demonstrate distinct types of behavioral temperament exhibited by the robot, including melancholic, choleric, sanguine and phlegmatic. These types of behavior are determined by ""regulators of temperament"" in the robot architecture. It is shown that emotions and temperament can be very useful for a robot in complex environments with unknown characteristics. Various in character environments can demand various types of behavior: in quickly changing environments the choleric behavior is more preferable and in stationary ones are phlegmatic, etc. In some sense, different psychological organization of a robot can be considered as a convenient mechanism of adaptation. Emotions and temperament as biologically inspired mechanisms allow us not only to describe but also to control the robot's behavior in a natural form. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of these studies was to inform policymakers about the real economic burden of risky behaviors and to provide conditions for evidence-based and well-informed decision making in this area. Methods: The cost-of-illness method was applied to estimate the social cost of substance abuse. The intangible cost was not included in estimation. A prevalence-based approach was applied to estimate the tangible cost. For the estimation of direct costs, a top-down method was used. Indirect costs were estimated using two methods: the human capital and the friction cost. Results: In 2008, the social cost of substance abuse in Russia comprised 677.2 billion rubles if the friction cost method is applied and 1965.9 billion rubles if the human capital method is used. The social cost of substance abuse is defined to the greatest extent by alcohol consumption, comprising about 45% of the economic burden. Illicit drug use comprises about 30% of the economic burden and tobacco consumption 25%. Conclusions: The results of economic studies demonstrated that psychoactive substances impose a considerable economic burden on society. Analysis of the substance abuse social cost pattern shows that the main losses that society bears because of these behavioral risk factors fall outside the health care system and lay in other sectors of the economy such as social care, law enforcement, and productivity losses. © 2014 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).","Alcohol; Illicit drugs; Social cost; Substance abuse; Tobacco","illicit drug; illicit drug; psychotropic agent; alcohol abuse; article; controlled study; cost of illness; decision making; evidence based medicine; high risk behavior; human; policy; prevalence; priority journal; Russian Federation; social aspect; social cost; substance abuse; tobacco dependence; alcohol consumption; alcoholism; Article; cost; disability; drug dependence; economic aspect; fire; friction cost; health care cost; health care policy; health care system; health education; human capital cost; law enforcement; medical decision making; medical research; mortality; orphaned child; productivity; public health service; risk factor; smoking; social behavior; social care; substance abuse; tobacco dependence; traffic accident",,"Elsevier Inc.",,,,,22121099,,,"English","Value Health Reg.

The industry itself is very energy consuming and capable of producing major environmental damage. For a long time, however, innovative ways of production were low on their priority list, leading to heavily outdated equipment and hardware. Recently, Russian oil- and gas producers have kicked off major programs to catch up with their western counterparts. Until now, however, insights into the importance of environmental management of oil and gas producers are very limited. We studied the annual reports and environmental reports of the six most prominent industry actors between 2008 and 2010 and analyze their changing approaches to green management. Most companies start in 2009 to address their environmental activities in the statement of the CEO and chairmen. In 2010, the environmental activities have made it up to the list of top priorities in the companies. On an industry-level, we find that management's own initiatives drive companies' adoption of greener production technologies and are much more influential than government regulation. In fact, we see that leading industry actors inform government regulation and thereby lift up the greening of production also in late followers. Green innovation either stems from international cooperation for industry leaders or out of in-house knowledge generated through own R&D institutes. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Environmental management; Green management; Oil- and gas producer; Russia; Russian Federation; Stakeholder","corporate strategy; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; environmental legislation; environmental management; gas production; governance approach; innovation; oil industry; Russian Federation",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",,,,,09644733,,,"English","Bus.

A quadratic programming algorithm for the problem is proposed. A synthetic data generator for a comparative study of the stratification algorithm is developed. The novel algorithm appears to be competitive to a bunch of other approaches on synthetic data.

The survey involved 9th grade students who took the TIMSS-2011 international test in 2010-2011 (3,797 students from 41 regions of Russia) and their parents. Logistic regression is used to build models where the dependable variable is school children's expectations about their future employment and the independent variable is groups of factors accounting for family background, cultural capital and personality traits of respondents. Family characteristics turned out to determine students' expectations much less than personality traits, especially the self-assessment level. Besides, parental preferences about their children's future employment have no impact on students' opinion. The author suggests that the following phase of the study should be used to evaluate realization of schoolchildren's predictions about when they were going to start working and whether they were going to continue their school education, as well as to assess the changes in the value systems held by students and their parents in forming their expectations.","Educational trajectories; Employment trajectories; Expectations; Family capital; Longitudinal studies; Personality traits; schoolchildren",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

The query image is recognized by matching its descriptors with the descriptors of reference images. The matching is usually done by summation of distances between descriptors of corresponding blocks. Unfortunately, such approach does not lead to a correct distance between vector of points (histograms of each block) if popular square of Euclidean distance is used as a discrimination. To calculate the correct discrimination, we propose to sum the square roots (or, more generally, appropriate nonlinear transformation) of distances between block histograms. Such approach is experimentally examined in a face recognition problem with FERET and AT&amp;T datasets. The results support the statement that the proposed approach provides higher accuracy (up to 5.5%) than state-of-the-art methods not only for the Euclidean distance but for other popular similarity measures (L1, Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, chi-squared and homogeneity-testing probabilistic neural network). © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","face recognition; histogram of oriented gradients (HOG); homogeneity testing; Image recognition; Jensen-Shannon divergence; nearest neighbor; probabilistic neural network; Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)","Face recognition; Graphic methods; Image recognition; Neural networks; Statistical methods; Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG); Homogeneity testing; Jensen-Shannon divergence; Nearest neighbors; Probabilistic neural networks; Scale invariant feature transforms; Mathematical transformations","","Springer Verlag","4th International Conference on Computational Modeling of Objects Presented in Images: Fundamentals, Methods, and Applications, CompIMAGE 2014","3 September 2014 through 5 September 2014","Pittsburgh, PA",106895,03029743,9783319099934,,"English","Lect.

No goods are ambiguous by default, not even digital virtual ones. Ambiguity may arise in many ways, but this article examines one specific process: ambiguity that occurs when entities appear as objects that blur category boundaries. Ambiguity is created around pre-existing categories through socio-material entanglements. This article explores how a central category in consumer capitalist societies-property-takes on ambiguous forms in distributions and recirculations of prestige items in the massively multi-player online role-playing game Final Fantasy XI. Prestige objects are powerful, sought-after armour and weapons acquired in the game world by completing difficult battlefields or tasks, often in large groups. When discussing these items, respondents are not confused actors trying to make sense of slippery things. Instead, they produce ambiguities around property by blurring distinctions between gifts and commodities. Blurred boundaries help resolve tensions arising from different orderings of people, relations and things. Hybridised property forms allow selective alienation of goods, allowing participants to privilege some relations and connections over others. With this article, I hope to spark further debate on building a conceptual toolkit to explore ambiguities, and contribute to increasing interest in non-dyadic gift relations in consumer culture research. 'Ambiguous goods' is not a viable category for thinking about things, people and relations or digital virtual objects. But ambiguity can be a useful way to think about how people and things-whether they are digital, virtual or neither-are related. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",,,,,14720817,,,"English","J.

Now, with the rise of Internet communications, writing skills have become one of the key factors facilitating successful social integration of an individual. Analyzing the fundamental principles of mass-scale writing skills teaching used in Great Britain, Canada and the US, the author suggests changing the writing skills development pattern that has been established in Russian schools. First, these changes should address the texts that serve the basis for student essays. The most impor tant features of such texts appear to be a con - flict, an emotional state easily recognized by children, and a strong author's presence. Second, it is necessary to revise the forms of writing students do in class or at home. In particular, Russian teachers are advised to learn from Graves' method of teaching children to make contents that would be meaningful for themselves and not predetermined by their teachers. Sample compositions included in language development course books is another area that needs revision. The paper gives the grounds for providing the tools consistent with the author's conception and not restricted to literary language, instead of merely teaching norms. A good source of exercise could be the Russian National Corpus, the electronic database reflecting all the current trends of contemporary writing. The author believes that implementing these ideas would promote, inter alia, association of different social groups based on acknowledging the importance of cultural traditions.","Essays; Sample compositions; School education; The Russian National Corpus; Written language",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Cluster is an organizational form of efforts combined to achieve competitive advantages in general education system. The key benefit of building clusters is that the educational market is entered by communities of concerned members, instead of individuals. University takes on a leadership role in innovating general education through: training and re-training human resources of general education; updating the syllabus; monitoring training materials and taking direct participation in their development; pursuing research (sociological, economical, psychological, legal, managerial) in education; monitoring quality of education process.

According to Isidore, justice (iustitia) is related to the written law (ius); this word is primarily used with reference to mundane justice and legislation. In the same time it may be a just legal order, established by God, and in this sense iustitia is partly associated with aequitas. On the contrary, an equity (aequitas) is based on natural law (ius naturale) and signifies the primordial order, natural and obvious to everyone. It's main feature is equality of all the people. Nevertheless (even in the same Isidore's works) the concepts of aequitas and iustitia look like interchangeable synonyms: the original distinction between them disappears little by little, as long as God is accepted to be an ultimate source for both iustitia and aequitas and a passage in the ""Differences"" I.32 (68) appears a mere scholastic exercise in distinguishing the concepts which no longer differ in practice.","Aequitas; Human and divine justice; Isidore of Seville; Iustitia; Reception of the Roman legal tradition",,,"Center for Ancient Philosophy and the Classical Tradition",,,,,19954328,,,"Russian","Sch.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905406102

It argues that sovereignty often is used as a powerful argument which allows the setting aside of international humanitarian standards and the formal constitutional guarantees of human rights. This conflict between sovereignty and human rights also recurs in other countries, and many legal scholars are demanding the revision or even abandonment of the concept of sovereignty. In Russia, this conflict is aggravated by some characteristic features of the traditional mentality frequently favoring statism and collective interests over individual ones, and by the state building a 'power vertical' subordinating regional and other particularistic interests to the central power. These features and policies are studied in the context of the Slavophile-Westernizer philosophical divide. This divide reveals the pros and contras put forward by the Russian supporters of the isolationist (conservative) policy throughout contemporary history-especially in the sovereignty debates in recent years. The 1993 Russian Constitution contains many declaratory statements about human rights and democracy, but their formulations are vague and, thus far, have had little concrete effect in court battles where the application of international humanitarian law from time to time has been counterbalanced by the concerns of the protection of sovereignty. These concerns coincide with isolationist and authoritarian policies, which in 2006 led to their amalgamation in the concept of 'sovereign democracy'. This concept is considered in this article to be a recurrence of the Russian conservative tradition. Even though the concept in its literal meaning has been abandoned by its author and supporters, most of its ideas remain on the cusp of the official political discourse which reproduces the pivotal axes of Russian political philosophy of the XIX century. © Copyright 2014 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","democracy; human rights; individual liberties; international law; legal mentality; Russian Constitutional Court; Slavophiles; sovereignty; Westernizers",,,"Martinus Nijhoff Publishers",,,,,09259880,,,"English","Rev.

He understands spirit as one of several naturally functioning human mental agencies, such as consciousness, will, memory, etc. That is, he treats the mental agency of spirit in a scientific way and avoids any esoteric or religious connotations that this peculiar term may involve. The nature of human spirit, according to Scheler, is the ability to withstand and deliberately redirect biological imperatives and instinctive drives, up to the point of purposefully throwing away one’s own life. The presence of spirit constitutes the essence of the human being that differentiates him qualitatively from all animals. In this article, I argue that it is human spirit that plays the determinative role in causing heroic and self-sacrificial behavior. I also argue that the individual human spirit experiences its inherent development, thus having several rather dissimilar stages and manifestations. I discuss the meaning that the term ‘spirit’ has in the English and the American philosophical and psychological traditions and the meaning of the corresponding term ‘der Geist’ in the German traditions. The specific English-language understanding of the term ‘spirit’, compared to its German counterpart ‘der Geist’, namely, less scientific and more religious and esoteric and metaphorical for the former, makes it alien and almost unusable in the English and American traditions. The linguistic difference leads to the misunderstanding of some very important ideas brought by the concept of spirit as introduced by Scheler. My purpose is to overcome this discrepancy and omission and to introduce the notion and the concept of spirit, in their scientific understanding, into the arsenal of modern English-language cognitive science, psychology, and philosophy in order to provide for the full explanatory force of the hitherto neglected concept of spirit. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Evolutionary psychology; Heroism; Max Scheler; Moral psychology; Philosophical anthropology; Political behavior; Political psychology; Self-sacrificial behavior; Spirit; Terrorism","altruism; ego; Germany; history; human; politics; psychological model; psychology; war; Altruism; Ego; Germany; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Humans; Models, Psychological; Politics; Psychology; War",,"Springer New York LLC",,,,,19324502,,,"English","Integr.

The Russian case results in unsuccessful and unsustainable repatriation, the German case exhibits a change from sustainable repatriation to a slow termination of the program, while the case of Kazakhstan is one of sustainable and relatively successful repatriation. The main argument of the paper is that in order for a repatriation program to be sustainable, the program must contain both a practical component and an ideological component. If a repatriation program lacks ideological backing which permeates other aspects of political life in a state, then the repatriation program grinds to a halt. If a repatriation program has ideological backing, but is rendered impractical and does not meet the economic, demographic and labor market needs of a state, then the further development of the program stops.

This is one of the clear reasons why the concept of Smart Cities recently attracted a great amount of attention, both from academia and city planners. One of the challenges of the Smart City concept is how to raise human capital among people, such as making them culturally sensitive, mobile and to improve other social characteristics. This challenge is especially valid for industrial cities that are facing economic turbulence and a demand for revitalizing their public spaces and economic specialties. The aim of this study is to examine the correlation between the amount of international students in Russian universities with the positive changes that occur in a Russian student's human capital, and their neighbourhood areas, especially in public spaces. We aim to support the hypothesis that a network of ""internationalized"" universities serves as a revitalization measure for a city, facilitating the development of its surrounding areas, and reducing political and social risks within a society. Research methods for gathering data are: deductive trend search, which uses a literature review from leading academic journals and the empirical study based on the created questionnaire. This questionnaire forms a dataset which consists of a number of master courses held in English from one of the leading Russian universities based in Moscow.

Within the phenomenological framework of intentionality there is an interwining of perspective and object to which this perspective is directed. As soon as we try to apply to consciousness subject-object schemes, then we immediately come across paradoxes. It is impossible to determine consciousness by means of subject-object, not only because it is neither an object nor a subject, but also because consciousness inevitably turns out to be ""prior"" to such distinctions. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Georgian philosophy; Merab Mamardašvili; Phenomenology in Russian philosophy; Philosophy of consciousness; Russian philosophy; Soviet philosophy",,,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",,,,,09259392,,,"English","Stud.

It is shown that closer acquaintance of Marx with Quesnay's Tableau Ēconomique and with Cantillon's Essai occurred almost simultaneously, and this joint discovery led him to supplement his value-centred view of early classical economists with a new circular flow, or macroeconomic perspective within which Cantillon's role was recognised to be crucial.

Having analyzed statistical reports on the Russian Federation as a whole, as well as on Moscow and Krasnoyarsk Krai in particular, we created a picture of an average school principal and identified their specific features across the regions (age, gender, years of experience, competencies, etc). Upon investigation of decision-making styles (A. Rowe's Decision Style Inventory) used by school principals in Moscow and Krasnoyarsk and by award winners in the School Principal professional competition, we found out that contextual factors, personal and professional attitudes of a school principal have considerable effects on the school leadership style. The paper also gives an insight into the changes in school leadership styles in the recent decades, managerial methods used by Russian school principals, similarities and differences between school leadership practices in Russia and Canada. As it turned out, the directive decision-making style prevails in practices of both Moscow and Krasnoyarsk Krai school principals. The same style, which discourages efficient interaction between school administrators and teachers, is largely adopted by Canadian school principals even after education reforms implemented in the country. Meaningfully different results were demonstrated by the sample consisting of school principals who had won in the professional competition: about 60 % among them use the conceptual school leadership style on a regular basis.

At the same time, a pure-strategy local Nash equilibrium (in which the candidates do not necessarily choose identical positions) exists for a large set of such functions. Hence, if the candidate payoffs are unrestricted, the ""mean voter theorem"" for probabilistic voting models is shown to hold only for a small set of probability of vote functions. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,,"Springer New York LLC",,,,,01761714,,,"English","Soc.

The paper is based on the results of a 2013 survey among graduate students of Russian universities on their educational and career strategies conducted as part of the Monitoring of Education Markets and Organizations project. Data was analyzed using descriptive analysis and regression analysis: influence of factors was assessed through a logistic binary choice model (logit regression). It is shown that the most positive effect on probability of combining work and study is given by such factors as learning in a leading university, studying a Master's degree, specializing in areas of study connected with foreign languages, mathematics, computer programming, design, architecture, and culturology. Receiving no financial support from family, studying on a state-funded basis, and being male also increase probability of student employment significantly. The research performed has allowed to suggest hypothetically that combining work and study is most often caused by desire to gain work experience, with more talented students working more often, obviously. By doing so, students try to get to look more productive, which may later bring an economic profit to them in the labor market.

However, unlike in other countries, Russian professors attach special importance to nonmaterial resources: personal role in specific structural subdivisions, involvement in communication, team spirit in decision-making.

Khrushchev discontinued the Stalinist bonds in April 1957 and, in their wake, introduced ""cash-and-goods lotteries"" featuring voluntary participation. The Khrushchev government identified a powerful positive incentive to buy tickets in the coveted consumer goods the lotteries offered as prizes.

Such students have an array of reasons to start working, from the ambition to get integrated into the job market and build a career to the desire to fill their spare time. The paper investigates how different combinations of work and study affect academic performance of students in their final years in Tatarstan higher education institutions. The author analyzes results of the first phase of 'Monitoring educational and employment trajectories of school and higher education institution graduates', the longitudinal studies initiated by NRU HSE in 2009. Two factors - employment schedule and the extent to which employment corresponds with what is studied - have helped single out five types of combining work and study. Different combinations reveal different levels of academic performance, different plans for the future, and somewhat different motivation to enter higher education institutions. A regression analysis has shown that only one type of combining work and studies, non-professional full-time employment, has a negative effect on academic performance. The rest of the student employment strategies haven't shown any statistically important effect on performance. All other conditions being equal, professionally employed students perform better than non-professionally employed ones, and sometimes even better than those who don't work at all. The perfect choice for students is professional part-time employment, when work becomes an additional source of knowledge and motivation to learn.","Academic performance; Combining work and study; Motivation; Student employment",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Managers and entrepreneurs studying in the business school impose different requirements to content of educational programs and to organization of teaching process, depending on what changes they expect after graduating with MBA degrees. Based on these expectations, MBA students may be classified into three categories: stable, horizontally mobile, and vertically mobile. The stable type (40%) believes that business education will give them more self-confidence and help them secure their social status and current position in the company. Horizontally mobile students (34%) expect to change their job or field of activity after graduating from the business school. Vertically-mobile students (26%) envisage a career progress, a pay rise, an improvement of social status, or getting a job in a top corporation or in an international company. The conclusion is, business education can perform different functions for different categories of students, so maximum efficiency of MBA programs may be achieved through student segmentation and educational program differentiation (more detailed elaboration of educational content to adjust it to students' demands; diversification of the set of subjects, etc.). Modern Russian business schools are rather unwilling to initiate research to study demands of both prospective students (including their status specifics, expectations, needs, and motivation for MBA studies) and employers (e. g. their requirements to successful candidates for specific positions), which blunts effectiveness of the business education system significantly.","Business-education; Expectations; MBA; Social mobility",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

On the first step the frame of taxonomy is built manually according to some representative educational materials. On the second step, the frame is refined using the Wikipedia category tree and articles. Since the structure of Wikipedia is rather noisy, a procedure to clear the Wikipedia category tree is suggested. A string-to-text relevance score, based on annotated suffix trees, is used several times to 1) clear the Wikipedia data from noise; 2) to assign Wikipedia categories to taxonomy topics; 3) to choose whether the category should be assigned to the taxonomy topic or stay on intermediate levels. The resulting taxonomy consists of three parts: the manully set upper levels, the adopted Wikipedia category tree and the Wikipedia articles as leaves. Also, a set of so-called descriptors is assigned to every leaf; these are phrases explaining aspects of the leaf topic.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper explores the impact of intangibles and exogenous shocks on corporate attractiveness for investors measured by market value added. Specifically, the relationship between intangible-driven outperformance of companies, measured by economic value added (EVA) and a number of intangible drivers on macro-, meso- and micro-levels is analyzed. It is supposed that the process of value creation is not only confined to companies’ performances. The empirical research was conducted on &#x003E; 900 public companies from Europe and the USA during the period of 2005-2009. Findings – The study establishes that investment attractiveness is affected by intangibles. It is found that a company’s experience, size and innovative focus facilitate value creation. An unexpected result was revealed concerning countries’ education level, which appears to be an obstructive condition for intangible-driven value creation. Research limitations/implications – The study reveals the significance of industry belonging for intangible-driven value creation. Nevertheless, it does not discover the particular characteristics of industry that influence corporate attractiveness for investors. These issues could be addressed in future research.

With this in mind, a discussion will be conducted on the interconnection between the right to express views, partially accepted in Russia, and the right to participate, which has been denied to the child due to the traditional attitude towards minors. The conclusion will be that the right to participation should be considered a broader one which cannot be equated with the right to express views. Nevertheless, the latter is the core and the basis for other related rights. Further, an overview is provided of the legal framework and practices that implement the child’s right to express views and participate in the decision-making process. Finally, traditional perceptions with regard to children and their rights and the specifics of Russian democracy will be explored, as well as the way that they influence the right of the child to express his / her views. It will be argued that Russia is not in favour of the child’s right to express views given the revival of ‘traditional values’ as reflected in the legislation and supported by state policies, and together with a clear rejection of the primacy of international standards in the field. Observance of the child’s right to express his / her views will not only support their formation as active citizens of their country (and of the regional and global community) free of traditional biases but will also promote further child participation. © 2014, Supporting Academic Initiatives Foundation.

Therewith the influence of social beliefs is mediated by the educational justice evaluation. Participants were 895 students of the 1-st and the 4-th year from four Russian universities (54% female, Mage = 19, SDage = 1.64). Three methods-measurement of belief in dangerous and competitive world; assessment of justice in conducting difficult credit/exam; motivation to learn in the university-were used in the research. They completed the Dangerous World Beliefs Scale, Jungle World Beliefs Scale, Organizational Justice Scale and Academic Motivation Scale.The results partly support hypotheses and demonstrate that the procedural justice evaluation moderates correlation between social beliefs and learning motivation.","Belief in dangerous and competitive world; Motivation to learn; Organizational justice; Theory of self-determination",,,"Russian Academy of Sciences",,,,,02059592,,,"Russian","Psikhol.

It is shown that these psychological features can be simulated fairly simply. The proposed emotion-based architecture of the robot control system leans upon the Simonov informational theory of emotions, while the specific features of temperament are reduced to a two-parameter model of the excitation-inhibition type. Experiments performed with mobile robots are described. These experiments demonstrate a set of various types of robots’ behavior: melancholic, choleric, sanguine, and phlegmatic. All these types were implemented using the so-called temperament controller, which determines a balance between the excitation and inhibition parameters of the robot control system. An FSM-based model of temperament is also proposed that makes it possible to describe the behavior of an individual. Using this model, it is shown that, for performing certain collective behavior tasks, it is useful to have in the group individuals with different behavior so that this behavior also depends on the individual emotions and temperament of robots. © 2014, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,"Control systems; Experiments; Behavior-based; Collective behavior; Psychological features; Robot control systems; Two-parameter models; Robots",,"Maik Nauka-Interperiodica Publishing",,,,,10642307,,JSSIE,"English","J.

Universities have been known to create a stimulating context for generations to share and acquire skills. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of research in the field of intergenerational learning and skills sharing. The topic is important as the ideas of teacher-student (T-S) and teacher-teacher (T-T) collaboration based on the principles of interdependence and reciprocity between generations have become acute in the era of the information society when the generation gap is widening. Learning Management System (LMS) projects are believed to enforce human development and collaboration of adults and young learners in universities. The paper dwells upon the importance of needing to be aware of peculiarities of human development in applying IGL policies to education. Better understanding of such internal psychological factors as motivation, creativity and intelligence will allow the level of generation integration and knowledge creation to rise. The paper proposes the idea that LMS training sessions and LMS products as a virtual platform can be effective tools for intergenerational learning collaborations. In this paper we are mainly interested in presenting the results of the projects aimed at increasing ICT competence of teachers. The description of the LMS programs, project outcomes and the LMS product itself are given in the paper.

The common ground between Foucault and Gadamer is that both thinkers militate against the notion of understanding as a process guided by universal criteria of rationality (in particular against Habermas’ notion of non-distorted communication) maintaining instead that individuals are inextricably embedded within a particular tradition. Foucault, we maintain, is extremely important for Gadamer in that he develops a mode of critical relationship towards the tradition but precisely understood as a dynamic within the tradition itself, renegotiating and expanding the space of personal freedom; this process, no doubt, being guided by engaged individual perspective and self-understanding without any recourse to an Archimedean point of view outside of any tradition. In doing so Foucault is able to provide a much needed method of immanent critique of ideological distortions (potentially always present in the tradition, discourse or language) that remains faithful to the basic tenants of Gadamer’s hermeneutic outlook. We consider a model that schematically demonstrates how such immanent critique can be carried out. We take Gadamer’s notion of understanding as realised in an open and charitable dialogue and internalise this dialogue within a single subject taking place between two distinct perspectives: a critical Foucauldian perspective on the one hand, and the immediate self-undertstanding of situated subjectivity on the other. This internal dialogue should enable the subject to maintain a critical distance with respect to aspects of oneself that are a product of social practices and conditions (as demanded by critics of Gadamer), yet remaining within the space of Gadamerian dialogical understanding situated in the first-person ontology.","Dialogue; Hermeneutics of suspicion; Hermeneutics of trust; Ideology; Philosophical hermeneutics; Prejudices; Understanding",,,"Saint-Petersburg State University",,,,,22265260,,,"Russian","Horiz.

Their subjunctive is often functionally identical to the indicative; in contexts where other verbs obligatorily take the subjunctive form, these two predicates may use the indicative. The main factor that controls omissibility of the subjunctive particle is shown to be an epistemic interpretation. I consider some typical cases where the subjunctive and the indicative are synonymous for these predicates, and those where they are not. Thus, in the apodosis of conditional constructions the particle is often omitted, although, in general, Russian prefers a symmetrical use of the subjunctive in both protasis and apodosis. On the other hand, when in the protasis, the particle is not omitted. The subjunctive is often used with the modals for pragmatic purposes, such as politeness.

The first two sections are devoted to discuss-ng epistemic, moral and political objectives of education. The last section discusses one of the most controversial topics of contemporary philosophy of education -the professional status of teachers. Ability to comprehend critically social and political conditions of formation and spread of knowledge appears to be one of the essential epistemic objectives of education. Attention towards implicit fundamentals of expert knowledge and ability to find relevant nformation to verify beliefs are epistemic virtues contributing to formation of an autonomous cognizing individual. Among ethical objectives of education, we have traditionally singled out personal autonomy, ability to live a full social and economic life, comprehensive personal development, civic (democratic) competencies, and cooperation skills. The last twenty years, largely due to feminist and communitarian criticism, have witnessed development of an attitude that consists in finding the paramount goal of education in inculcating the ideals of love, care and community spirit, instead of autonomy of a rational individual. Implicitly ethical objectives of education are closely related to ""distributive"" objectives that define the final provider of teaching efforts. Having analyzed discussions on professionalization of teachers' activities, we conclude that, although teaching is characterized by some prominent features of professional activity, its specific nature makes it difficult to establish distinct criteria of professionalization.","Epistemic objectives of education; Moral and political objectives of education; philosophy of education; Professional status of teachers",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Two common European trends have been studied as driving forces of transformation: 1) institutional differentiation based on introducing the multi-level education system and 2) reform of the relationship between the higher education and the mass public. It appears that the multi-level system is implemented in Russian higher education through a State-initiated vertical differentiation of higher education institutions based on their research and development achievements and through a concentration of resources in a limited number of leading universities. We believe that an institutional differentiation like that, with different program levels, discards some crucial points: heterogeneity in the group of leading universities that get the pre-emption right to implement Master's programs; inherent heterogeneity of individual higher education institutions that may have both high R&D potential departments and mass-market oriented ones; the danger of inhibiting the enthusiasm of universities by imposing rigid limitations on their activities, while Master's degrees remain merely a source of profit for them. We are convinced that no consistent cooperation between employers and higher education in Russia is explained by the fact that, being guided by the Bologna Process principles, higher education outstripped employers by developing educational standards long before most industries adopted their occupational standards. We have singled out four models of university activities in the context of higher education system transformation: 1) research university, 2) system integration university, 3) regional integration university, and 4) human resource construction university.","Consistent transformation; Higher education; Institutional differentiation; Multi-level education; Research universities; The Bologna Process",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

To assess how time and money investments in preparation courses affect the USE scores, we systematized results of empirical studies on the issue, analyzed the main forms of preparation courses in Russia and built a model of learning strategies followed by applicants that allows to evaluate return on investment in extra training in terms of the growth of the final USE scores. It was established that in new institutional admission conditions students use the same conventional forms of preparation to exams as before, although they had been expected to resort less to extra training after unification of the examination system. We conducted a poll among first-year students and their parents, altogether including 1,600 households in the 16 largest cities of Russia. Estimation of the modified academic performance function revealed a positive relationship between investment of money and time in preparation courses, on the one part, and results of the exam, on the other part, although the return on such investment turned out to be rather low. On the one hand, it means that USE results come from efforts applied by candidates; on the other hand, it means that students who take preparation courses may win in terms of the final results, which may bring about inequality in access to higher education. In a number of cases, the effects of school and of academic performance are more powerful than those of preparation courses. The paper formulates topics for further research: comparison of return on investment to preparation courses for students in localities with essentially different markets and tutorial opportunities (cities and towns, satellite towns, villages), analysis of learning strategies followed by students with different motivation in their choice of university, i. e. willing to earn the minimum passing score or aspiring to get high scores in order to qualify for a top-ranked university.","Learning strategies; Preparation courses; Social inequality; Tutorials; University applicants; USE",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

More than 38% of the sample firms were liquidated over the period 1999 to 2013. We find that privatization and the choice of privatization option have no effect on the long-term survival of firms in Russia, but that managerial ownership lowers the likelihood of both liquidation and bankruptcy.

In Russia this rise united the features of Russian ethnonationalism and imperial enthusiasm. The Russian philosopher Vladimir Ern (1882-1917) in his article ""From Kant to Krupp"" (1914) attempted ""to ground"" the hostility between Russia and its allies, on the one hand, and Germany, on the other hand. This attempt turned Ern's article into one of the earliest manifestoes of cultural racism in Russia, maybe the very first one. Discussing this article in the context of other works by Ern of 1910-1917, one can see that Ern applied Friedrich Nietzsche's genealogical method for the political interpretation of ""the problem of technology"" causing the aggressive approach to the human's environment. Nevertheless, Ern's cultural racism and aggressive rhetoric blocked further development and even reception of his methodological innovations. The psychological compensatory pragmatic of his rhetoric seems to resemble the analogical function of rigid opposition between ""Russia"" and ""West"" in speeches of contemporary Russia's official ideologues. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cultural racism; First World War; French Germanophobia; German anti-Semitism; Russian Germanophobia; Russian philosophy of 20th century; Vladimir Ern",,,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",,,,,09259392,,,"English","Stud.

The authors inquire which of these RTOs are successfully competing for public funding, and how these funds are used. Also, the authors study what makes an RTO more (financially) successful in technology transfer than their peers and which RTOs transferred technology that was new to the Russian market. Design/methodology/approach – This research is based on 62 RTOs which reported technology transfer to enterprises with main economic activities classified by NACE rev 1 as “A – agriculture, hunting and forestry” and “B – fishing” and “C – mining and quarrying,” including oil and gas extraction. Findings – The authors found remarkable differences between the Russian RTOs and their OECD peers, but also differences between agriculture and mining. Interestingly, competitive funding plays a different role in both industries. In agriculture, a more conservative funding paradigm prevails, and competitive funding is less important and more reliance on classical annually revolving funds is given. Competitive funding here is more used to strengthen basic R&D and to generate patentable knowledge, while in mining, these funds support technology transfer. Originality/value – This is, to the knowledge, the first detailed study on Russian RTOs servicing her primary sector. The authors believe that studying these RTOs is of great value as RTOs are broadly under-researched and various scholars have called for more fine-grained analyses to better understand their role in the innovation system. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Primary sector; Research and development; Research and development organization; Russia",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,14601060,,,"English","Eur.

Firstly, through the analysis of a passage found in “Logical Investigations”, the author will show Husserl’s earlier position with respect to the problem of practical intentionality. He will then go on to critically assess this position and, with reference to some of Husserl’s works written after the 1920’s, prove that every intentionality should be regarded as practical intentionality. Correspondingly, transcendental phenomenology should also be characterized as practical philosophy. The author makes this statement with the following two senses in mind; transcendental phenomenology is practical philosophy, firstl, in the sense that it investigates various forms of practical intentionality and, secondly, in the sense that transcendental intentionality as the grounding source of transcendental phenomenology is also a kind of practical intentionality. © Г.

Report document's completeness is being checked according to its original technical documentation (or technical statement). The base of the method is searching of key words (markers), which determine the introduction of a term and define borders of an important fragment. Selected fragments are divided into collocations of fixed size and added to a special list. The report document is also divided into fragments, which are compared with important fragments of technical documentation using selected collocation list. Every fragment of the report gets measure of similarity during the comparison. The measure helps evaluating the amount of the useful data in each paragraph. The compared text is represented as a dot-diagram compiled from the whole document. Besides the dotdiagram, that shows presence or absence of collocations in the text, we used another type of diagram showing links between fragments of report document and technical documentation. Every fragment of the technical documentation is assigned to a unique color that sequentially changes along the technical documentation's diagram. We used the same color to show the similar fragment of report documentation. Reinforced by this visual information, an expert can easily make decision on the report's quality. Besides expert can get a required fragment of text for a closer examination. The described method of visualization allows the expert to determine, if the considered report can be either easily rejected because of lack of useful information, or can be used for closer examination. Note, the described method can be applied to documentations and reports written under specific format only. The technical documentation should include the requirements to the form and content of report document, but not to the main concepts that it will be described.","Automatic text processing; Document examination; Visualization results","Text processing; Automatic text processing; Document examinations; Fixed size; Measure of similarities; Technical documentations; Visual information; Visual representations; Visualization results; Visualization",,"National Research Nuclear University",,,,,20793537,,,"Russian","Sci.

We have identified and described the key features of international university networks as a form of inter-university partnership: pre-requisites for establishment, geographical location of partners, types of partner organizations, status of partners, entry barriers for new partners, specialization profiles, financing of activities, management of activities, forms of partner cooperation. We have also analyzed engagement of higher education institutions of different countries in the international university networks, particularly membership of the leading Russian universities in such networks and in other international educational associations. It appears that Russian universities are represented insufficiently in the international university networks. Accession is a challenging task that will require universities to apply considerable efforts, both organizational (overcoming entry barriers, negotiating with networks managers and partners, ensuring a certain level of openness in activities of the university, meeting the network requirements, performing the tasks assigned to network members on time) and financial (entry and annual fees, business traveling).

Examples of such markets include marriage market, universities-applicants market and others. Gale and Shapley in 1962 first introduced this kind of problems in the literature. They considered one-to-one and one-to-many markets, where preferences of individuals on the one side over individuals on the other side were strict. In this paper we analyze a modification of the classical Gale-Shapley admission problem, where preferences of universities are considered to be interval orders. Interval order allows a specific form of indifference in the preference relation. Imagine, each alternative is described with an interval [l, u], and one alternative dominates another if and only if intervals do not overlap and lower bound of the first interval is greater than upper bound of the second interval. Preferences with such property may occur in the cases, when applicants' scoring system (interview, exam or sum of points) is not exactly accurate. In the previous paper we have shown the existence of a stable matching and provided the criteria of applicant Pareto-optimality of a stable matching, based on Stable Improvement Cycles. However, the Pareto-efficient stable mechanism is not (in general) strategy-proof for applicants. We provide a strategy-proof applicant-proposing deferred acceptance with tie-breaking, where tie-breaking procedure is organized in a special way. This special tie-breaking allows to lower chances of an applicant-inefficient stable matching (in comparison to that with random-tie breaking). © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Interval orders; Matching model; Pareto-efficiency; Stable matching","Pareto principle; Interval orders; Matching models; Pareto efficiency; Pareto-optimality; Preference relation; Stable matching; Strategy-proofness; Two sided matching; Commerce","Chinese Academy of Sciences, Research Center on FEDS;currexSole;Global Action Inc.;National Research University Higher School of Economics;University of Nebraska at Omaha;Yandex LLC","Elsevier B.V.","2nd International Conference on Information Technology and Quantitative Management, ITQM 2014","3 June 2014 through 5 June 2014","Moscow",105641,18770509,,,"English","Procedia Comput.

Official statistics on manufactured alcohol sales, regional price increase and real disposable income were used.Results: Homemade distilled spirits (samogon) consumption decreased together with that of recorded and unrecorded manufactured spirits since 2000. The consumption of spirits was partially replaced by the consumption of beer and wine. These trends in alcohol consumption were interrupted in 2008-2013. The interruption was more likely affected by the economic crisis and recession than by the new alcohol policy. Social networks and availability of unrecorded alcohol were more important predictors of homemade alcohol consumption and purchasing than was a recorded alcohol price increase.Conclusions: Homemade alcohol consumption does not replace the declining market for recorded spirits in Russia. The effects of economic and social factors on homemade alcohol consumption are greater than are the short-term effects of the new alcohol policy. The very recent (2015) reduction of the minimum unit price of vodka may be premature. © The Author 2015. Medical Council on Alcohol and Oxford University Press.

The main part of this article is devoted to the concept of the ""international argument"" and provides an analysis of three types of appeal to the international community: the pragmatic, the reputational, and the communicative. The increasing importance of international communication during this period is shown on the basis of examples drawn from German philosophical discussions that took place between the first third and the end of the nineteenth century (the case of Friedrich Eduard Beneke and Hermann Ebbinghaus). The last part of the article examines the impact on German science and philosophy of the cessation of international communication during World War I. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Friedrich Eduard Beneke; Hermann Ebbinghaus; International communication in science; Internationalization of knowledge; Philosophical argumentation; The journal Logos; World War I",,,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",,,,,09259392,,,"English","Stud.

The official discourse of the period of 1920s-1930s was characterized by the emphasis on the idea of revolutionary rupture with the old [imperial] university tradition. In contrast, from mid-1930s and later, still during Stalin's lifetime, the emphasis shifted to the discussions of the struggle of 'progressive professorship' for the advanced ideals and Russian science. Then, in 1960s-1980s the idea overcame of direct succession between Soviet and pre-Revolutionary university. After 1991 the idea of 'classic university' became the most important administrative concept and the rationale for privileges legitimization. The prominence of this notion is motivated by the desire to preserve the academic hierarchy and the intrinsic structure of the university of the Brezhnev era. © 2014 eum (Edizioni Università di Macerata, Italy).","Communism; Conceptual imagery; History of education; Soviet union; University; XX century",,,"Centro Edizioni Universita Macerata",,,,,19711093,,,"English","Hist.

Nevertheless, this issue is crucial to answering questions about where the lower threashold for the copyrightability of a work lies. Indeed, it is essential to determining which intellectual works with an insignificant creative component but of high economic importance (e.g., databases, computer software, advertisement slogans or design work) are to be copyrightable. Analyses of debates in legal literature and court rulings issued over the past few years warrant the conclusion that there is a trend in favor of setting more relaxed standards of originality and creativity and granting copyright protection to works of low authorship. This article addresses the problem of identifying criteria for copyright ability and noncopyright ability in the Russian legal system. It models various types of demarcation criteria, and analyzes their strengths and weaknesses. It also describes the trend in Russian judicial practice of granting copyright protection to works of low authorship, whilst outlining some of the problems and contradictions that this entails.

Sometimes such caesuras raise doubts in the continuity of the University's history and suggest the existence of different studia generalia that alternated with each other for the period under study. However, contemporary historians and members of the university community view the different universities as parts of one and the same university. Our case-study demonstrates that this view is based on the documents concerning economic privileges granted to the University by the country's rulers and the Roman popes. If recognized as a new university, the studium generale would have lost its former privileges.

The development of this tradition in the late 20th and early 21st century led to the formation of a cognitive poetics that uses methods of modeling processes of versification. This paper extends these methods to the comparative study of the processes involved in the emergence and development of analogous versification systems in different languages. In particular, the paper studies the origins and early phases of the evolution of syllabo-tonic versification in the 16-18th centuries in English, Dutch, German, and Russian. It shows that the German type of versification differs significantly from both the English and the Dutch. This difference is apparent in the greater constraints on versification and in the lesser degree of freedom it displays in the realization of rhythm-forming units.

These factors include: regional economic structure; stage of economic development (growth or decline); share of public sector industries in regional economics; specific territorial characteristics resulting in discrepancy between average monthly wages and the real standards of living in regions. The paper has revealed a change to teachers' pay at different educational levels in regions of Russia between 2011 and the first half of 2013. The level of teachers' pay shows a trend towards reducing inequalities and polarization in distribution of regions by personal income. At the same time, purchasing power of teachers' wage is growing more and more heterogeneous across the federal subjects of the Russian Federation. As compared to 2011-2012, when purchasing power of teachers' wage was at the same level in more than 50% of regions, the first months of 2013 witnessed an increase in the number of levels, as well as in that of regions at different levels. Teachers' wage varies significantly by its purchasing power across federal subjects that have achieved or almost achieved their teachers' pay goals.

In this article, we develop an approach to measuring city brand equity by evaluating city quality.

This cannot be measured directly but can be evaluated through the city quality, which, in turn, represents the ability to fulfil residents' needs. This study uses the conjoint analysis technique to measure city quality as a driver of consumer-based city brand equity. The approach is applied to the case of city branding campaign in Perm, Russia, to examine the roots of the city's brand failure and propose the ways to strengthen consumer-based city brand equity. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","City brand equity; City quality; Conjoint analysis; Residents' preferences",,,"Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.",,,,,17518040,,,"English","Place Brand.

This focus is put forward as an effective way of philosophically elaborating what are argued to be the twin aspects of the statement—the being that transcends predication, and an irreducibly first person ontology. This elaboration is performed by discussing the way in which these two themes have been approached at certain pertinent points in the history of metaphysics. With regard to the theme of transcendent being, an overview of the medieval Scholastic debates on the issue precedes a direct discussion of the Heideggerian position. As for the theme of the irreducibility of first person ontology, an overview of the relevant theories of the various German Idealist philosophers precedes a direct engagement with what Heidegger has to say on this issue. The overall argument here is that it is possible coherently to conceive of the pure being that transcends all entities in terms of the ‘I’ of an absolute subject without eliding the difference between being and entities, without succumbing to what Heidegger regards as an onto-theological oblivion of being. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Being; Exodus 3:14; German Idealism; Heidegger; Scholasticism; Subjectivity; The absolute",,,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",,,,,00381527,,,"English","Sophia",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893856623

As the study shows the structural features of electoral authoritarianism not only ensure the victories of 'approved' candidates but also make the rare oppositional winners to adapt to the existing regime and change the political affiliation. If the regime gets more authoritarian the oppositional party can still be a tool to win a local election. But after being elected, the winner finds himself in another political environment of existing patron-client relations, and has no other choice than to become a dependent member, or an agent (according to principal-agent theory) in higher-level clientele. As a result, oppositional party has become useless in the recruitment of influential executive power elite. However, while blocking unwanted 'invasion' of opposition into the executive power the regime allows opposition to be presented in the leadership of regional legislative power. This policy reflects the necessity to make an opposition more loyal and included into the system of power relations in most safe and efficient for the ruling elite way. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","co-optation; dominant party; opposition; Party system; patron-client relations; principal-agent relations; regional power; repression; spoils",,,,,,,,15705854,,,"English","Perspect.

One way to address this challenge is by introducing f lexible remuneration mechanisms which are countryspecific yet still share certain basic principles such as a relationship between compensation and research productivity. Improving R&D workers' remuneration is particularly urgent now in Russia given researchers' low salaries in many areas of science (particularly considering the complexity of their work). To address the problem of compensation for researchers, new policy measures have been adopted since 2012. This paper presents new evidence from Russia's scientific community - researchers, managers of R&D organisations, and government representatives - collected via a survey and focus group discussions on the desirability and efficiency of the current remuneration policy. Although most members of Russia's scientific community do not question the necessity and relevance of the government's 'efficient contract' initiative in the R&D sector, its implementation has had a more mixed response.

The author specifically problematizes the views of Russia’s civilizing mission as expressed by participating writers, who were commissioned to explore the empire’s diverse littoral populations - the potential resource of sailors. Focusing on the ethnographic essays penned by expedition participants such as Aleksei Pisemskii, Apollon Maikov, Mikhail Mikhailov, Sergei Maksimov, and Ivan Goncharov, the author demonstrates that the problem was not those writers’ belief in Russia’s civilizing mission itself, but their understanding of the ultimate goal of “civilizing.” The majority (with the exception of Pisemskii) were inclined to advocate complete assimilation of ethnically non-Russian peoples. And all the participating writers tended to classify peoples of the empire along rigid cultural and even biological hierarchies, which suggests that the discourse of racialization had already revealed itself in Russia by the 1850s.

The Vygotsky-Luria system is one of the models which makes it possible to reorganize activity and develop certain supports. Therefore it is important to evaluate the influence of the rehabilitation interventions on the quality of life of an elderly patient with progressive cognitive disorders. In this article we describe the techniques and ways of neurorehabilitation and demonstrate the influence of 'psychological prosthetics' on improving the quality of life of a patient with cognitive disorders. Methods: A single case study of an elderly man, 78 years old, experiencing sight and cognitive disorders. Results: We distinguished 8 main difficulties, for which techniques and practices were developed, first of all, to engage external means and to organize the environment properly. Conclusions: Focused neuropsychological rehabilitation with the selection of the main 'goals' of rehabilitation and the construction of various supports, including those based on the Vigotskiy-Luria system, enriches the quality of a patient's life, increases their independence, social engagement and improves the emotional atmosphere within the family.","Aging; Neuropsychological rehabilitation; Vigotskiy-Luria approach to neurorehabilitation","adaptation; aged; amnesia; anxiety; article; attention disturbance; case report; cognitive defect; cognitive rehabilitation; decision making; disorientation; distractibility; emotional disorder; executive function; fall risk; family relation; human; human activities; impulsiveness; independence; male; mental instability; neuropsychological rehabilitation; neuropsychological test; personal hygiene; quality of life; social interaction; speech disorder; time perception; vertigo; visual impairment; Vygotsky Luria neurorehabilitation approach; wakefulness",,"Agencja Wydawnicza Medsportpress",,,,,17307503,,,"English","Acta Neuropsychol.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904020025

The problem defined by the administrators of the Faculty of Management at the National Research University - Higher School of Economics (Saint Petersburg) consisted in reorganizing four existing groups of second-year Bachelor's students into three new groups. The fundamental requirement was to keep the friendly and collaborative relationships that had developed between students. Technical requirements included ensuring equal sizes of the new groups (26 students) and equivalent levels of academic performance (measured by the average semester grade). We present a solution algorithm which is based on SNA tools and includes two possible strategies for groups with different interaction patterns: 1) the ""weak link"" strategy (selecting the most fragmented student group that can be easily divided into loosely connected subgroups, breaking it down and distributing the clusters among the other three groups); and 2) the ""melting pot"" strategy (reorganizing all the four groups into entirely new clusters based on the degree of student interaction). A comparison of performance ranking scores achieved during the following 18 months revealed a growth of the average grade in groups reorganized with regard to interpersonal assessment and interaction. The suggested grouping method may be used to rearrange student groups or courses in situations where some students get dismissed or transferred, or with a view to create project teams for research classes or scientific labs.","Academic performance; Collaborative learning effects; Girvan-Newman algorithm; Social Network Analysis; Student groups",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

State-of-the-art batch-mode adaptation algorithms assume that speech of particular speaker contains enough information about the user's voice. In this article we propose to allow the user to manually verify if the adaptation is useful. Our procedure requires the speaker to pronounce syllables containing each vowel of particular language. The algorithm contains two steps looping through all syllables. At first, LPC analysis is performed for extracted vowel and the LPC coefficients are used to synthesize the new sound (with a fixed pitch period) and play it. If this synthesized sound is not perceived by the user as an original one then the syllable should be recorded again. At the second stage, speaker is asked to produce another syllable with the same vowel to automatically verify the stability of pronunciation. If two signals are closed (in terms of the Itakura-Saito divergence) then the sounds are marked as ""good"" for adaptation. Otherwise both steps are repeated. In the experiment we examine a problem of vowel recognition for Russian language in our voice control system which fuses two classifiers: the CMU Sphinx with speaker-independent acoustic model and Euclidean comparison of MFCC features of model vowel and input signal frames. Our results support the statement that the proposed approach provides better accuracy and reliability in comparison with traditional MAP/MLLR techniques implemented in the CMU Sphinx. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","Automatic speech recognition; CMU Sphinx; linear autoregression model; phoneme recognition; speaker adaptation; voice control","Linguistics; Quality control; Regression analysis; Signal processing; Automatic speech recognition; Autoregression models; CMU Sphinx; Phoneme recognition; Speaker adaptation; Voice control; Speech recognition","ENSICAEN;et al.;European Association for Image and Signal Processing (EURASIP);Institut Universitaire de Technologie Cherbourg Manche;International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR);Universite de Caen Basse-Normandie","Springer Verlag","6th International Conference on Image and Signal Processing, ICISP 2014","30 June 2014 through 2 July 2014","Cherbourg",105931,03029743,9783319079974,,"English","Lect.

In particular, the authors test the hypothesis that USE results in different subjects are equally efficient predictors of further student performance. Methods of regression analysis have been used to assess how preliminary examinations (both total USE points and points in specific subjects) affect academic performance in higher education. The research involved about 19,000 students enrolled at five Russian higher education institutions between 2009 and 2011. As long as the sample included institutions of different profiles, individual regressions were calculated for each faculty. A meta-analysis of regression coefficients was performed later to bring the data together. Average firstyear grade was used as the key university performance factor. It was found out that USE points were only related to performance in the second and the subsequent years through performance in the first year, i. e. indirectly. The research results allow to conclude that predictive capacity of total USE points is high enough to accept this examination as a valid student selection tool. The explained variation in university performance varies from 15 to 35% in different faculties. Predictive capacity of particular subjects making the USE total points is relatively the same, but USE points in mathematics and Russian are often the best predictors of performance. The paper also analyzes the relation between USE points and another student selection tool - results of academic competitions in specific subjects.","High school academic competitions; Higher education performance; Meta-analysis; Predictive validity; Preliminary examinations; Unified State Exam",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

One of the main accusations directed toward globalization is that it deepens the gap between the developed and developing countries dooming them to eternal backwardness. The article demonstrates that the actual situation is very different. It is shown that this is due to the globalization that the developing countries are generally growing much faster than the developed states, the World System core starts weakening and its periphery begins to strengthen. At the same time there is a continuing divergence between the main bulk of developing countries and the group of the poorest developing states. The article also explains why the globalization was bound to lead to the explosive rise of many developing countries and the relative weakening of the developed economies. In the forthcoming decades this trend is likely to continue (although, of course, not without certain interruptions). It is also demonstrated that this convergence constitutes a necessary condition for the next technological breakthrough. This has important implications for the hegemony debates. A rather popular theory of hegemony cycles implies that the eclipse of the global hegemony of the United States should be followed by the emergence of a new global hegemon.

We do not find the study of the future within this dichotomy fruitful.

The expected losses are determined by three parameters. The first is the probability of default (PD) of the borrower. The methods of PD estimation were studied in detail by previous authors, and the most common method is credit scorecard development. The second parameter is exposure at default (EAD). Except for revolving loans, it is known in advance, it is the current balance (principal amount plus accrued interests) of the loan. Finally, there is a third parameter that defines the expected losses. This is the so-called loss given default (LGD) which is in effect the share of EAD, which is irretrievably lost in the event of default.

In this paper we show that the problem can be reduced to one of the two string problems which we call Top-k and Sorted-Top-k. Given an integer k and two sets of pairwise distinct strings (queries) with weights, Q and Qtest, the Top-k problem is to find, for each query q ∈ Qtest, its shortest prefix q[1..i] such that q belongs to the list of k heaviest queries in Q starting with q[1..i]. The Sorted-Top-k problem is to retrieve, for each q ∈ Qtest and 1 ≤ i ≤ |q|, a position of q in the sorted list of the k heaviest queries in Q starting with q[1..i].

An analysis of oeuvres was aimed at differentiating between formal and substantive meanings of the term ""university responsibility"". Substantive meaning of responsibility appeals to criteria beyond knowledge, appreciates the crucial importance of education effects in various aspects of life, and derives from the very fact of interdependence between the university and the society. We believe that importance of university as an institution forming the society may specifically be put into question in Russia, where the high level of education coexists weirdly with the high level of social hardship. An online questionnaire was completed by more than one third of graduates of a Russian confessional (Orthodox) university residing in more than 100 localities of Russia, former Soviet Republics, and other foreign countries. The data on graduates' shared values and attitudes obtained in the survey was compared to results of national and international surveys on family issues, civic engagement, values, employment, social capital, and consumption practices. Based on this comparison, we suggest that philosophies and attitudes of Orthodox university graduates have many common points that set them aside from the other population of Russia: they are committed to family and civic values, have a strong attitude of service, and participate in social activities to help people in need. Standardized indices of social capital in the sample of Orthodox university graduates are three times higher than those in the national sample of all higher education graduates. We propose to raise a critical discussion of the role of religion in higher education and to dwell specifically on issues of validity of theology as a scientific discipline, effects of bringing religion to high school, and the problem of confessional universities.","Confessional universities; Social capital; Social responsibility; Universities; Values",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

The results demonstrated the significance of both the country of residence and the country of birth as well as values, which are common in these countries.

Furthermore, migrants’ values better correspond to values that are common in the country of residence than values widespread in the country of birth.

If we look for the causes of future collisions in the 1586 court hearings, then we should speak more generally about the conflict between the faculties of theology and arts, between the Dean and the Rector, or between the Sorbonne and the college of Navarre. Latent rivalry, hitherto shadowed by struggle against 'common' enemies, such as Protestants and Jesuits, or against royal encroachments on academic privileges and property (such as Pré-aux-Clercs) and attempts to implement a radical reform of colleges, would boil over into an open conflict in the middle of the seventeenth century. The history of the University served as a weapon in all these conflicts.

In contrast to subcritical thermodynamics, in which the number of collective degrees of freedom undergoes a jump in the phase transition “ gas-liquid,” the given invariants in supercritical thermodynamics remain valid on the whole isotherm.

We offer strong support for this premise by looking at coup attempts. Cross-national time-series evidence from interstate dispute participation over the period 1960–2000 indicates that a country in a militarized confrontation with another state is about 60% less likely to experience a coup attempt in the subsequent year. Consistent with our hypothesis, we establish that it is mainly militarized involvement in disputes, rather than non-militarized involvement, that is associated with lower coup likelihood.

However generic relations do not establish any functional dependence between the arguments, and therefore it is questionable whether they can be thought as reasonable generalizations of functions. On the other hand, in some situations (typically in differential calculus) one can speak in some precise sense about an implicit functional dependence defined by a relation. It turns out that it is possible to model linear logic with implicit functions rather than general relations, an adequate language for such a semantics being (elementary) differential calculus.

Scientific capital is a well-known concept for measuring and assessing the accumulated recognition and the specific scientific power. The concept of scientific capital developed by Bourdieu is used in international social science research to explain a set of scholarly properties and practices. Mathematical modeling is applied as a lens through which the scientific capital is addressed. The principal contribution of this paper is an axiomatic characterization of scientific capital in terms of natural axioms. The application of the axiomatic method to scientific capital reveals novel insights into problem still not covered by mathematical modeling. Proposed model embraces the interrelations between separate sociological variables, providing a unified sociological view of science. Suggested microvariational principle is based upon postulate, which affirms that (under suitable conditions) the observed state of the agent in scientific field maximizes scientific capital. Its value can be roughly imagined as a volume of social differences. According to the considered macrovariational principle, the actual state of scientific field makes so-called energy functional (which is associated with the distribution of scientific capital) minimal. © 2014 Yurij L.

By definition, upbringing engages the deep-lying moral attitudes of people, the moral and cultural values that have always been disputed by the society. Upbringing inevitably involves conflicts; moreover, its social utility is hard to measure. These two factors combined, without active interference of the State, may gradually kill the upbringing practices, which is far not the best possible option for the national policy. First, in this case general education school would stop existing as a social organization. Schools with stronger educational components are more stable. Second, upbringing only forms a part of human capital. Beside cognitive skills, human capital also includes social capital and creative capital, which are the real key players in post-industrial economies. If the upbringing component of the national education system is lost, it may degrade the quality of human capital required at the next stage of national economic development. Third, Russian upbringing practices are based on a significant experience of global importance; a lot of funds have been invested to organizational and financial structure of upbringing throughout many decades. To modernize upbringing, we should tie it closely to economic and social development needs of the country. Governmental or nonprofit grants could be provided to fund a number of projects to be implemented by regional teacher associations. The Creative Leader program, for example, consists in creating reliable instruments to measure creative and cooperation skills, developing reasonable standards to determine what creative and cooperation skills children must have and use at each age, reconciling these standards with those of general education, introducing a competitive program to create specific forms of working designed exclusively for contemporary children, and discarding without mercy everything that worked with previous generations only.","Human capital; Religious upbringing; School; Supplementary education; Upbringing; Values",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Digitized virtual monies seem ephemeral, almost ideal typical examples of money as a pure medium of exchange. This paper begins with the premise that virtual monies are as value-laden and morally entangled as any other form of money. This assertion is demonstrated by exploring how one type of virtual money, the Linden dollar (L$), and some of its associated practices are bound up with research participants’ moral categories and judgments in the virtual world of Second Life (SL). Participants’ accounts of virtual money practices are linked to moral attributes, sometimes in stark ‘good’ or ‘bad’ dichotomies, but also in more nuanced terms. These framings reproduce classifications of people and practices along a continuum with virtuousness at one end and maliciousness or harm at the other, passing through various states of possible moral dubiousness. For respondents, these two judgments go together; people are what they do with money. As a result, respondents decide what ‘people like that’ deserve. Evaluating someone’s money practices means assessing the person. Participants’ accounts of Linden dollar practices overlap with explanations of what SL is and how residents should live there. In SL, money is a form of material culture through which appropriate ways of being in the world are debated and reproduced. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Moral boundary drawing; Moralities; Second Life; Virtual economies; Virtual money; Virtual money practices; Virtual worlds",,,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",,,,,21599149,,,"English","Distinktion",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957811531

The basic example of such a manifold is a twistor space of a hyperkähler or a 4-dimensional anti-selfdual Riemannian manifold X (not necessarily compact). We prove “a holography principle” for such a manifold: any meromorphic function defined in a neighbourhood U of S can be extended to M, and any section of a holomorphic line bundle can be extended from U to M. This is used to define the notion of a Moishezon twistor space: this is a twistor space admitting a holomorphic embedding to a Moishezon variety Mʹ. We show that this property is local on X, and the variety Mʹ is unique up to birational transform. We prove that the twistor spaces of hyperkähler manifolds obtained by hyperkähler reduction of flat quaternionic-Hermitian spaces by the action of reductive Lie groups (such as Nakajima’s quiver varieties) are always Moishezon. © 2014, International Press of Boston, Inc.

It aims to identify the factors underlying a (non)-convergence of these actors into a common representation or an ""official transcript"" of their activities. The case study of the adoption of a national anti-corruption strategy in Georgia in 2005 reveals the difficulty of these two actors to validate their representations and to sustain a coherent image. Certain inherent contradictions in the relations between donor organisations and transition or developing countries, in particular in the juxtaposition of the two notions of a ""transfer of external knowledge"" and ""local ownership/political will"", are viewed as the main factors behind this problem of validation. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","anti-corruption; development; donor-government relations; Georgia; ownership; social construction of success",,,"Routledge",,,,,21599165,,,"English","East European Polit.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84895908474

The Soviet advances in mathematical economics give an occasion to reflect on the extension of the Walrasian paradigm to nonmarket societies, as well as on the ideological effects of general equilibrium theory and its interpretations in a Soviet context. Our contribution is focused on the development of general equilibrium theorizing in the work of Victor Meerovich Polterovich (b. 1937), who has been one of the leading figures in mathematical economics and general equilibrium theory in the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia. His papers on the abstract models of exchange, dynamic general equilibrium and optimal growth theory, excess demand correspondences, monotonicity of demand functions, and disequilibrium theory were for the most part published in English and gained considerable attention within the field. We reconstruct the political and ideological basis of the general equilibrium concept and show how abstract mathematical models reflected the discursive shift from optimal centralized planning to various forms of decentralization.

It proposes an analysis of party cadres' conceptualization of culture that provided the basis for the creation of the state monopoly on cultural production of the young Soviet regime in the early 1920s. Particular attention is given to Lenin's differentiation between ""bureaucratic"" and ""cultural"" motivations to labour that, after the October Revolution of 1917, allowed to substantiate the shift in the point of view on socialism from a political to a cultural one. The building of the new Soviet statehood required a moderate depoliticization, the renunciation of the radical revolutionary rhetoric of class struggle in internal policy and the reinterpretation of class, social and cultural contradictions. Attention is drawn to the importance of cultural debates for the creation of the unique Soviet mechanism of governance that separated the principal ideological role of the party from the operative administration of the state machinery. At the centre of the analysis there will be no ""theories"" of culture or doctrinal diversity of Marxist-Leninist approaches but there will be the modes of culture's problematization within the sphere that was defined by Michel Foucault as gouvernementalité. A group of specific texts is analyzed, in which governmental rationality and problematization of cultural policy were directly presented.

There is demand for updated information about the the current state of research and challenges faced. This paper discusses the potential of patent analysis and surveys the Russian biotechnological market with both quantitative and qualitative methods. It reviews key statistical and analytical findings of empirical research. The main finding is that the Russian biotechnological market has a relatively high level of dependence on foreign technologies: among biotechnological patents published in Russia in 2012, a third was granted to non-residents. In Russia, foreigners are active in patenting universal methods and techniques useful for biotechnological advancement. This may constrain future Russian organizations' access to results and methods and therefore block some directions of biotechnological research within the country. Among other challenges, are the following: a low involvement of the Russian commercial sector in developing biotechnologies, a lack of cooperation between the segments of the market, and a disadvantaged position of some subfields, such as eco- and aqua biotechnologies and bioenergy. By using patent data, we identify active actors contributing most significantly to progress of biotechnologies in Russia, and we focus on dynamically developing subfields, such as biomedicine and pharmaceuticals.","Biotechnologies; Genetic engineering; Patent activity; Patent analysis; Patent classification",,,"National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics",,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902509933

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a detailed literature review devoted to an evaluation of foresight and traditional projects. The approaches to project evaluation in the field of project management were investigated, and the main steps of traditional project evaluation process were determined. The most commonly applied steps of foresight evaluation were identified by the analysis of recent foresight evaluation projects. The comparison of evaluation frameworks for foresight projects and traditional projects allows to provide recommendations for foresight evaluation framework improvement. Findings: The paper identifies several lessons for foresight evaluation from project management. The elements which can enrich foresight evaluation framework are the following: the development of an evaluation model; the extensive use of quantitative methods; the elaboration of evaluation scales; the inclusion of economic indicators into evaluation; and the provision of more openness and transparency for evaluation results. Originality/value: Given the importance of foresight evaluation procedures and the lack of a commonly applied methodological approach, the value of this paper consists in identifying a foresight evaluation framework and enriching it with elements of project management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Evaluation; Foresight; Framework; Project management",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,14636689,,,"English","Foresight",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897105883

A great contribution to the negative part of globalisation was of economic instability that occurred at the beginning of this century and which consequences are still present in the world. In this article, we presented the impact of economic instability on the price index trough a comparative analysis of transition countries such as Montenegro, Serbia and Croatia over a period of five years (Croatia has just recently become a member of the European Union and due to that fact it was included in this study).

This paper describes an original approach to designing natural language interfaces for the action-based applications as the complements and alternatives to traditional graphical interfaces. The principal peculiarity of this approach is that it is based on a formal model of natural language structured meanings. The first part of the paper outlines the main properties of the class of SK-languages (standard knowledge languages) which is used for building semantic representations of user commands. The class of SK-languages can be employed for representing the meanings of input texts from practically interesting sublanguages of English, French, German, Russian and other natural languages. The theory of K-representations (knowledge representations), introducing the class of SK-languages, was developed by V.A. Fomichov and described in his monograph published by Springer in 2010.

Another book, entitled The Saturnine Fate, concerned archaic prose poetry devoted to the war that had just begun. Šklovskij borrows an official military rhetoric and changes its accents, turning it into an instrument of pacifism. It should be stressed that 1914 was the same year the new Formalist theory started growing, reaching a first intellectual peak in 1916 when the key Šklovskij essay, Art as Device, was published. At the same time, Šklovskij had been drafted into the army, and war became a fruitful background for this emerging theory. Šklovskij first served as an instructor in the armored car division; following the February 1917 bourgeois revolution he was actively involved in agitation for the Provisional Government as a commissar, first on the Western front, then later on the Southern front. After the Russian bourgeois revolution of 1917, as events grew out of control, the explosion of history required simultaneous reflection. Šklovskij began writing memoirs long before he reached old age, based on his own conception of the genre. A war depicted in a book with the intertextual title Sentimental Journey is reconstructed here as a mechanism paralleled principally with the automobile; a means of transport to be handled with care. In the first part of the book, the war is seen as having a specific order of things, as opposed to a revolution which follows more the path of chaos. However, throughout his journey, Šklovskij observes the logic of events and concludes that the processes of war and revolution do not stand opposed, but instead have a consequential relationship. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Constructing the biography; Russian Formalism; Russian Revolution; Theory of literature; World War I",,,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",,,,,09259392,,,"English","Stud.

Among the many tasks PIAAC is aimed on the identification and measurement of differences between citizens and countries in the area of key competencies, evaluation of the impact of skills on individual economic and social achievement, the effectiveness of various national educational and training systems in providing necessary skills as well as the creation of the conditions for lifelong learning. PIAAC draws the first ""profile"" and pathbreaking results of Russian adults' key competencies on literacy, numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich environment. The central part of the paper is dedicated to a general analysis of the role of competencies and competence-based approach, a description of the research method, sampling and tools used (including test samples) in the PIAAC, and particularly in Russian Federation. Finally, the paper deals with the first results of the adult competencies research in Russian Federation. The results on identified key competencies are presented in accordance with various age groups, and include gender and qualification level differences. PIAAC is a long-term research project. Russia participated in the programme in 2009- 2013. Over 5000 adults aged between 16 and 25 from 25 regions and 94 localities participated in the programme in Russia. The total sample included 3800 respondents; it is representative for the whole country except Moscow and Moscow Oblast. The average points Russia obtained in reading and mathematical literacy are comparable to those obtained in OECD countries. Nearly half of working-age adults in Russia either don't have any computer experience or are incompetent users. As compared to OECD citizens, computer skills of Russian adults are more often restricted to doing only simple tasks (like logging in and out of their email boxes). As the level of education grows, so does the level of competencies of adult population in Russia. Similarly, competencies seem to accumulate with ageing, until the peak age of 45-49 years is reached. The discussion of the first PIAAC results and brief statement of research questions for future studies are presented.","Adult competencies; Lifelong learning; Literacy; Numeracy; Problem-solving; Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies; Russia",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Business models of software distribution are constantly evolving as new technologies develop. Traditional retail versions of software products are mostly replaced with digital distribution of copies of software products. However, these ways of software distribution are by no means exhaustive. Functionality of software is not necessarily tied with provision of the copy of the relevant program to the user. Instead he can receive access to it via the Internet without the need to install software onto his computer. This type of business model received the name ""Software-as-a-Service"" (SaaS) or, sometimes ""Cloud Computing"". The legal nature of relations arising between the user and provider of distant access to such software is subject to considerable debate in Russia. The main problem is that at first glance it resembles the features of various types of contracts, recognized in the Civil Code of Russia, although not falling completely within any of them. At the same time the type of agreement chosen by the parties defines the legal framework, which governs relevant relations and relevant tax consequences. This article aims to analyze the nature of existing relations between the user and SaaS-provider and to define whether it can be characterized as a license, service, lease or some kind of sui generis contract. Based on the analysis the author comes to a conclusion that as delivery of copies of software becomes less and less relevant for the software industry, due to the new business models implemented by vendors, the rights to use the particular copy of software around which the traditional copyright regime has been built, become more and more superseded with the right to access such software. Thus traditional contractual models developed for IP distribution (license agreements, assignment agreements) and, more generally, the legal framework of existing copyright law that is centered on the core idea of the ""use"" of the copy, are no longer adequate regulators in the digital era where remote access to objects of copyright will soon start to dominate. © 2014 Alexander Savelyev.","Software as a service Software copyright Software licensing Application service provider","Copyright law; Software licensing; Software-as-a-Service",,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,02673649,,CLSRE,"English","Comput Law Secur.

Different types of exogenous and endogenous links which a company could have in different stages of the crisis are investigated. The findings suggest that there is a statistically significant and positive link between relational capital and a firm's value. Moreover, we identify several differences in the significance of the inputs during different crisis periods. The study provides both theoretical and practical insights into investments in intangibles for framing strategy decisions with a particular focus on the role of relational capital. This could provide scholars and practitioners with a working basis for understanding connections and the implications of strategising in the context of a company's networks.

The concept of Russia as the great power was changing during this time in two respects: first, there was an increasing reticence of self-assessments; second, we observe prioritization of protecting the country's own, mostly regional, interests as opposed to expansion which would be characteristic of a great power. Moreover, this period clearly demonstrates contradictions and dangers, engendered in the process of losing self-perception as that of the great power. The readiness of Russian political elite to part bit by bit with the status of the great power and to go to the status of a regional power is combined (as the events around Ukraine have shown) with unwillingness to sustain the new status of the country with the help of the capabilities of a soft power. Lack of these, as well as of the skills in their use, and finally, a desire to raise the rating of trust in the government with the help of ""a small victorious war"" have formed the basis for the aggressive upsurge towards Ukraine. In the absence of serious hard and soft capabilities, the splashes of aggressiveness in Russian foreign policy and of anti-Western sentiments in domestic political life are unlikely to have any lasting effect. They are able, however, to generate extremely negative long-term consequences for the country. © 2014 The Regents of the University of California.","Greatpowerness; Hard power; Resources/capabilities; Russia; Set of images; Set of roles; Soft power; Status",,,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,0967067X,,,"English","Communist Post-Communist Stud.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919490116

On one hand, the Russian political elite needs economic growth to keep social stability in the country and to limit mass protesting in big cities. Economic growth is impossible without investment, which explains Russian leaders' increased interest in improving Russia's business climate. On the other hand, influential interest groups (represented first of all by security and law enforcement agencies) try to expand their control on rent sources in the economy. These groups of interests could strengthen their positions due to fear of political protests. This strong conflict among different groups in the Russian elite creates additional uncertainty for investors and the business community, and can lead to economic recession independent of the level of oil prices and dynamics of global markets. Reversing these negative trends in economic development will be possible only with collective actions of different economic and political actors (including technocrats in federal and regional governments, representatives of large and successful middle-sized business and top-managers of public sector organizations) in the search for pragmatic solutions to the challenges faced by Russian economy and society. © 2013 Asia-Pacific Research Center, Hanyang University.","Bureaucracy; Investment climate; Modernization from above; Rents; Response to the crises; Russian transition economy; Violent pressure on business",,,,,,,,18793665,,,"English","J.

Drawing on semi-structured interviews focused on motives, the paper argues that some respondents found in volunteer work a way of regaining meaning, structure and belonging after experiences of social dislocation such as retirement and bereavement. The transition from social dislocation to ontological security via volunteering illustrates the way in which 'the social' - as expressed in fellowship, laughter, work, organizations and institutions - moderates charitable practice. From this perspective, volunteering appears as a relational, processual and affective practice of care; and as a sympathy catalyst - an institution that facilitates interpersonal sympathy exchanges and support for compassionate goals. The paper endorses a view of human subjectivity which takes seriously both human vulnerability and resilience - victimhood and agency - as well as the relevance of suffering and flourishing for social action.

It focuses on the relationships between state practices, policies and expert knowledge addressing the Roma in Italy; it does so by first contextualising recent ethnographic findings on Turin authorities' social inclusion practices addressing Roma within the history of national and regional policies for Roma; it then contextualises those policies within the history of expert knowledge about Roma. Unlike what other studies on abnormalisation suggest, we argue that the abnormalisation of Roma in Italy is not primarily predicated upon the idea that they are at present unfit to follow the norms of the majority; rather, it stays upon a historically rooted representation of Roma oscillating between the poles of potential re-educability and potential dangerousness. In the conclusion we encourage further comparative research on abnormalisation, especially including practices and knowledge addressing other European minorities such as the Jews. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","abnormalisation; Italy; minorities; nomadism; nomadness; Roma","comparative study; ethnic minority; ethnicity; knowledge; Italy; Lazio; Roma [Lazio]; Rome",,"Routledge",,,,,1070289X,,,"English","Identities",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897022458

This paper explains the above global discrepancies from an institutional perspective. In a contract-theoretical framework we demonstrate how PPPs can enable projects that are not feasible through standard public procurement arrangements. Incentives for private partners are created through extra benefits (often non-contractible) from their collaboration with the government (e.g. risk reduction, reputational gains, access to additional resources, lower bureaucratic burden, etc.). In a well-developed institutional environment these benefits are implicitly guaranteed, suggesting no need in a specialized PPP-enabling legislation.

The notion of ""belief"" combines the ideas, attitudes, and personal philosophies teachers apply in their work. We differentiate between traditional beliefs about teaching as a direct transfer of knowledge and constructivist beliefs assuming that students construct their knowledge themselves through specifically organized activities. We have analyzed the key teacher belief research projects: the OECD's Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS), the cross-cultural Teacher Education and Development Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M), and the Nordic-Baltic Comparative Research in Mathematics Education (NorBA) that we borrowed a questionnaire from. Our survey involved teachers of mathematics in three countries: 390 teachers in Latvia (of which 95 with Russian as their native tongue), 332 teachers in Estonia (of which 92 with Russian as their native tongue), and 1,096 teachers in the Russian Federation. We have found that differences between teachers in different countries were statistically important in all the variables used in the study, regardless of whether Estonian and Latvian teachers were Russian-speaking or not. All teachers implemented their beliefs in their everyday classroom practices. 36% of teachers in Russia had a high level of constructivism (as compared to 26% in Latvia and 18% in Estonia). Proportion of teachers with low levels of traditionalism in Latvia and Estonia (appr. 25% in both) was higher than the same proportion among Russian teachers (17.5%). We have come to a conclusion that different approaches to education system reforms in Russia and in the Baltic states have resulted in a significant diversity of beliefs among teachers of mathematics. Thus, proportion of teachers with low levels of traditionalist beliefs has grown in the Baltic countries more than in Russia, which explains to some extent higher PISA points of Estonian and Latvian students.","Beliefs; Constructivism; Mathematics teachers; Nordic-Baltic Comparative Research in Mathematics Education; PISA; School education; Traditionalism",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

When a firm has full bargaining power, the non-contractibility of this investment completely undermines the employee's incentives. However, the incumbent firm's inability to observe competing wage offers at the interim stage prevents it from completely expropriating the surplus, thereby creating incentives for the employee to invest. We demonstrate that commitment to a wage floor for the second period destroys the worker's incentives to acquire human capital, but makes turnover efficient. Therefore, such a commitment has value only if the return on the employee's deliberate investment in human capital acquisition is sufficiently low. When firms are privately informed about the productivity of their human capital acquisition technology, more productive firms offer higher entry wages to separate themselves from less productive firms. Furthermore, in contrast to the case of symmetric information about human capital acquisition technology, the commitment opportunity now has value for firms with higher return on investment: commitment to a wage floor acts as a substitute for raising the entry wage. © 2014 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin / Boston 2014.","asymmertric information; commitment; discretionary investment; incomplete contracts; specific human dapital",,,"Walter de Gruyter GmbH",,,,,19351704,,,"English","B.E.

Controlling here means to force a process to behave in a desirable way by ascribing priorities to transitions and hence transforming a classic Petri net into a Priority Petri net. Liveness and boundedness are crucial properties in many application areas, e.g. workflow modeling and bioinformatics. The main correctness property for workflow models is soundness, which can be reduced to the liveness and boundedness of a modified net. In biological models, liveness and boundedness are important for system stability. The problem of transforming a given live, but unbounded Petri net into a live and bounded one by adding priority constraints is studied in this paper. We specify necessary conditions for the solvability of this problem and present a method for ascribing priorities to net transitions in such a way that the resulting net becomes bounded while staying live.",,"Bioinformatics; System stability; Application area; Biological models; Boundedness; Correctness properties; Liveness; Time constraints; Workflow modeling; Workflow models; Petri nets","","CEUR-WS","23th International Workshop on Concurrency, Specification and Programming, CS and P 2014","29 September 2014 through 1 October 2014",,108816,16130073,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910047977

To achieve the purpose a linear function is estimated with the help of ordinary least squares method. Findings: The chosen set of IC proxy indicators explain the significant part of coaches' salary. Such proxies as improvement in the championship table and coach's image in media have a significant and positive influence on coach's salary. Whereas, lowering the position of the club does not considerably affect the coach's wealth. A clubs' financial capacities and budget also influences coaches' salaries. Research limitations/implications: Traditional limitation of proxy indicators-based studies is connected with their eligibility and complexity. Practical implications: The possibility to codify IC of a person enables to analyze core competencies necessary in a particular activity or profession for success achievement. Moreover a policy of inequality reduction should take into account that intangible assets are at the base of those persons wealth. Originality/value: This is the first paper that employs IC concept to people wealth while previous literature is dedicated to companies' or countries' IC. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Empirical study; Intellectual capital; Personal development; Welfare",,,,,,,,14691930,,,"English","J.

First, some conditions should be met to exercise such choice, of which the most important is the provision of reliable data on providers' performance to both patients and physicians as their agents, as well as increasing primary health care (PHC) providers' involvement in realization of patient choice. Second, expanding patient choice does not always lead to efficient allocation of resources in a healthcare system. This article explores these controversial developments by using empirical evidence from the Russian Federation. It shows that choice indeed has value for patients, but there are many areas of inefficient choice, which leads to misallocation of healthcare recourses. Thus, health policy in this area should be designed to ensure a reasonable balance between objectives of expanding choice and promoting more efficient organization of healthcare provision. Political rhetoric about unlimited patient choice may be useless and even risky unless supported by well-balanced programmes of supporting and managing choice. © 2013 The Author.","health policy; Patient choice; primary health care; Russian Federation","financial management; health care delivery; health care policy; health insurance; human; organization and management; patient preference; Russian Federation; Competitive Medical Plans; Delivery of Health Care; Financing, Personal; Health Policy; Humans; Patient Preference; Russia",,,,,,,02681080,,HPOPE,"English","Health Policy Plann.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891587676

The blow-forming tests were carried out at the temperature of 420 °C using aluminum alloy (AMg-6) sheets of a 1 mm thickness. Each test was performed at constant pressure. For each fixed value of the pressure, a series of experiments was carried out with different forming times to obtain evolutions of dome height H and thickness s. These data were processed by the proposed method to obtain the flow stress dependence on the effective strain rate. The constitutive equations were obtained by least squares minimization of deviations between the experimental variations of H and s and ones predicted by a simplified engineering model. On the basis of the obtained data, the optimum strain rate for AMg-6 processing was determined as one corresponding to the maximum strain rate sensitivity. © 2014 The Authors.

Following Gerasimov et al. (Comm Math Phys 294:97-119, 2010) we use the q-Toda integrable system obtained by quantum group version of the Kostant-Whittaker reduction (cf. Etingof in Am Math Soc Trans Ser 2:9-25, 1999, Sevostyanov in Commun Math Phys 204:1-16, 1999) to define the notion of q-Whittaker functions Ψλ(q,z). This is a family of invariant polynomials on the maximal torus T⊂G(here z∈ T) depending on a dominant weight λ of G whose coefficients are rational functions in a variable q∈ ℂ*. For a conjecturally the same (but a priori different) definition of the q-Toda system these functions were studied by Ion (Duke Math J 116:1-16, 2003) and by Cherednik (Int Math Res Notices 20:3793-3842, 2009) [we shall denote the q-Whittaker functions from Cherednik (Int Math Res Notices 20:3793-3842, 2009) by Ψ'λ(q,z)]. For G=SL(N) these functions were extensively studied in Gerasimov et al. (Comm Math Phys 294:97-119, 2010; Comm Math Phys 294:121-143, 2010; Lett Math Phys 97:1-24, 2011). We show that when G is simply laced, the function (Formula presented.) (here I denotes the set of vertices of the Dynkin diagram of G) is equal to the character of a certain finite-dimensional G[[t]]⋊ ℂ*-module D(λ) (the Demazure module). When G is not simply laced a twisted version of the above statement holds. This result is known for Ψλ replaced by Ψ 'λ (cf. Sanderson in J Algebraic Combin 11:269-275, 2000 and Ion in Duke Math J 116:1-16, 2003); however our proofs are algebro-geometric [and rely on our previous work (Braverman, Finkelberg in Semi-infinite Schubert varieties and quantum K-theory of flag manifolds, arXiv/1111.2266, 2011)] and thus they are completely different from Sanderson (J Algebraic Combin 11:269-275, 2000) and Ion (Duke Math J 116:1-16, 2003) [in particular, we give an apparently new algebro-geometric interpretation of the modules D(λ)]. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","19E08",,,"Springer New York LLC",,,,,00255831,,,"English","Math.

Process mining discovery algorithms deal with large data sets to learn automatically process models. As more event data become available there is the desire to learn larger and more complex process models. To tackle problems related to the readability of the resulting model and to ensure tractability, various decomposition methods have been proposed. This paper presents a novel decomposition approach for discovering more readable models from event logs on the basis of a priori knowledge about the event log structure: regular and special cases of the process execution are treated separately. The transition system, corresponding to a given event log, is decomposed into a regular part and a specific part. Then one of the known discovery algorithms is applied to both parts, and finally these models are combined into a single process model. It is proven, that the structural and behavioral properties of submodels are inherited by the unified process model. The proposed discovery algorithm is illustrated using a running example. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",,"Algorithms; Data mining; Behavioral properties; Complex Processes; Decomposition approach; Decomposition methods; Discovery algorithm; Extracting information; Process execution; Transition system; Petri nets","","Springer Verlag","35th International Conference on Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency, PETRI NETS 2014","23 June 2014 through 27 June 2014","Tunis",106194,03029743,9783319077338,,"English","Lect.

To answer this question we use Russian databases of international studies TIMSS and PISA. The sample included 4241 Russian students. They participated in both studies TIMSS-2011 and PISA-2012. Based on the previous literature and content comparison of TIMSS-PISA math items we argue that TIMSS items can represent formal subject knowledge, while PISA items represent real- life context problems. We divided TIMSS participants into 6 groups from the top performers to poor performers (based on class average PVs in math) and picked up 10 (and 20) hardest PISA items using One-Parameter Rasch Model. Then we checked the proportion of correctly done PISA items among the 10 (and 20) hardest ones in each TIMSS group of students. This indicator is measure of the ability to transfer subject knowledge in a new context and apply them to solve real-life problems. Positive relationship between the level of subject knowledge development and the ability to transfer and apply it to a every-day problems was found. The better student knows math, the more likely he will be able to apply this knowledge to solve problems in a non-academic context. This relationship is not linear. Students from the most successful TIMSS group had substantive benefit in handling PISA hardest items, but all other levels of TIMSS performance differentiated weakly success in contextual PISA problems.","Context tasks; Math; PISA; School learning; TIMSS",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

However, most respective papers limit their investigation period with the early or mid-2000s. In the authors' opinion, some of the global trends which revealed themselves particularly clearly in the second half of the 2000s call for a revision of the convergence issue. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Several methodologies for measuring the global convergence/divergence trends exist in the economic literature. This paper seeks to contribute to the existing literature on unconditional β-convergence of the per capita incomes at the global level. Findings: In the recent years, the gap between high-income and middle-income countries is decreasing especially rapidly. The gap between high-income and low-income countries, meanwhile, is decreasing at a much slower pace. At the same time, the gap between middle-income and low-income countries is actually widening. Indeed, in the early 1980s GDP per capita in the low-income countries was on average three times lower than in the middle-income countries, and this gap was totally overshadowed by the more than ten-time abyss between the middle-income and the high-income countries. Now, however, the GDP per capita in low-income countries lags behind the middle-income ones by more than five times, which is largely the same as the gap (rapidly contracting in the recent years) between the high-income and the middle-income countries. This clearly suggests that the configuration of the world system has experienced a very significant transformation in the recent 30 years. Research limitations/implications: The research concentrates upon the dynamics of the gap in per capita income between the high-income, the middle-income, and the low-income countries. Originality/value: This paper's originality/value lies in drawing attention to the specific changes in the structure of global convergence/divergence patterns and their implications for the low-income countries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Catch-up; Classification; Convergence; Development; Global studies; Globalization; Innovation; Low-income countries; Middle-income countries; Systems theory; Technological innovation",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,10650741,,,"English","Campus-Wide Inf.

We also argue that overall life satisfaction is a significant influence on satisfaction with work-life balance and also acts as a mediator for the influence of some demands and resources on both male and female freelancers’ satisfaction with work-life balance.

The first aim of the paper is to attract the attention of the researchers and educators throughout the world to a poorly recognized kind of existential risk: it is the dangerous consequences of misusing the information and communication technologies by adolescents in the context of permanently increasing intelligent capabilities of computers and an easy access to Internet. The second, principal aim of this paper is to propose a constructive way out: it is earlier than usually socialization of children in order to inscribe a deep awareness of social responsibility into the conceptual picture of the child and adolescent and to enable him/her to analyse the consequences of the fulfilled actions. The proposed way out is elaborated under the framework of a new scientific discipline called cognitonics. This way is provided by the System of the Methods of Emotional-Imaginative Teaching (the EIT-system). The constructive core of this paper consists of two parts. The first part considerably expands the Level of Consciousness model proposed by P.D. Zelazo in 2004. It considers fours levels of the development of conscious control of thought, emotion, and action and covers the child's age from one to four years. Our model is based on the EITsystem and introduces three additional levels, where the seventh level is called the level of enhanced awareness of social agreements and social responsibility. Our model covers the ages from five - six to 13 - 14 years. The second part of this paper's constructive core presents a new look at the process of education when the values of the student act like a lighthouse for the teacher at the moment of presenting material and arranging the process of education, the process of acquiring knowledge.","Cognitive engagement; Early socialization of children; Informational-aesthetic conception of developing cognitive-emotional sphere; Levels of consciousness expanded model; Methods of emotional-imaginative teaching; Misuse of information and communication technologies; Positive psychology movement; System of values; Theory of dynamic conceptual mappings","Information technology; Social sciences; Cognitive engagement; Conceptual mapping; Early socialization of children; Information and Communication Technologies; Positive psychology; System of values; Education computing",,"Slovene Society Informatika",,,,,03505596,,INFOF,"English","Informatica",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897983437

We examined the role of attention in trans-saccadic localization by asking participants to localize targets while performing an attentionally demanding secondary task. In the first experiment, attentional load decreased localization precision for a remembered target, but only when a saccade intervened between target presentation and report. We then repeated the experiment and included a salient landmark that shifted on half the trials. The shifting landmark had a larger effect on localization under high load, indicating that observers rely more on landmarks to make localization judgments under high than under low attentional load. The results suggest that attention facilitates trans-saccadic localization judgments based on spatial updating of gaze-centered coordinates when visual landmarks are not available. The availability of reliable landmarks (present in most natural circumstances) can compensate for the effects of scarce attentional resources on trans-saccadic localization. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Attentional load; Eye movements; Remapping; Spatial vision; Visual attention","attention; depth perception; eye fixation; human; photostimulation; physiology; psychomotor performance; saccadic eye movement; vision; visual acuity; Attention; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Saccades; Space Perception; Visual Acuity; Visual Perception",,"Springer Verlag",,,,,00144819,,EXBRA,"English","Exp.

Cognitive science dates back to the time when Soviet psychology reached its theoretical zenith, with Lev Vygotsky’s cultural-historical psychology taken up by his students and colleagues, first of all by Alexander Luria in his concept of the dynamic localization of higher mental functions, with Alexei Leontiev’s emerging theory of activity implemented in the studies related to the Kharkiv school of psychology (on the Kharkiv school, see Yasnitsky and Ferrari, 2008), and one more version of the theory of activity proposed by S. L. Rubinstein. Lacking scientific communication, Soviet experimental psychology of cognition and cognitive psychology tapped at the same issues from different theoretical viewpoints and, as a result, constructed two different understandings of the “cognitive subject,” quite far from each other, even if echoing each other in some respects. And it was not until the twenty-first century that these two began noticeably converging. Not so typical of science, cognitive science has got a specific birth date – September 11, 1956, the second day of the Information Processing Symposium at MIT, where three seminal talks were given. A linguist, Noam Chomsky, presented his original understanding of language in “The three models for the description of language”; a psychologist, George Miller, proposed a short-term memory model in his talk “The magic number 7 plus or minus 2”; and Allen Newell and Herbert Simon described the very first artificial intelligence model, “Logic Theorist,” proving formal logic theorems. The four speakers, together with Jerome Bruner, the founder of the first Cognitive Science Center at Harvard in 1960, are commonly considered as the fathers of cognitive science (e.g. Gardner, 1987; Thagard, 2005). © Cambridge University Press 2014.",,,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9781139028097; 9780521762694,,"English","The Camb.

The Russian military modernization programs are quite modest and aim to upgrade the Russian armed forces in the High North rather than providing them with additional offensive capabilities or provoking a regional arms race.

During the previous 10 years, Putin's rating had correlated closely with Russians' perceptions of the state of the economy. Yet the fall in his approval - from 79% in December 2010 to 63% a year later - occurred despite roughly stable economic perceptions. Comparing Levada Center polls from late 2010 and 2011, the paper explores both who (what types of respondents) grew disenchanted with Putin, and why (what issues or grievances prompted this switch). It finds that (a) the fall in support for the Kremlin - although faster among members of the ""creative class,"" women, the rich, and residents of provincial cities - was broad-based, occurring among all social groups examined; (b) attitudes toward immigration, the West, and Russia's international status, as well as assessments of public service quality, changed little during 2011; (c) Putin's declining popularity most likely reflected stronger - not weaker - economic concerns; although the proportion judging economic performance to be poor did not increase, those who saw economic weakness became much less supportive of the Kremlin. Russians appear to have increasingly blamed their political leaders for unsatisfactory economic and political outcomes. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","creative class; economics; pocket-book; presidential approval; public opinion; Putin; Russia; sociotropic","class; economic conditions; leadership; perception; political relations; public service; Russian Federation",,"Routledge",,,,,1060586X,,,"English","Post-Sov.

The structural properties of the graph constructed by means of the suggested measure can be used to evaluate potential profitability, performance of the stock market. The model was applied to Russian stock market and to US stock market for the time period from 2001 to 2011.

In both samples, support for terrorism is stronger among those who see democracy as a Western political system which is not suitable for Muslim societies. Perceived Western economic dominance is related to more support for terrorism among Muslims in Western Europe. In the Muslim countries, blaming the West for negative international relations is associated with greater support for terrorism. The associations found are remarkably similar across the Western European countries but vary considerably across the Muslim countries, preventing generalized interpretations. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that perceptions about world politics represent an important factor of pro-terrorist views among Muslims.

However, there are serious limitations to research on WM in aphasia largely due to the lack of an established valid measure of WM impairment for this population. The aim of the current study was to address shortcomings of previous measures by developing and empirically evaluating a novel WM task with a sentence-picture matching processing component designed to circumvent confounds inherent in existing measures of WM in aphasia. The novel WM task was presented to persons with (n= 27) and without (n= 33) aphasia. Results demonstrated high concurrent validity of a novel WM task. Individuals with aphasia performed significantly worse on all conditions of the WM task compared to individuals without aphasia. Different patterns of performance across conditions were observed for the two groups. Additionally, WM capacity was significantly related to auditory comprehension abilities in individuals with mild aphasia but not those with moderate aphasia. Strengths of the novel WM task are that it allows for differential control for length versus complexity of verbal stimuli and indexing of the relative influence of each, minimizes metalinguistic requirements, enables control for complexity of processing components, allows participants to respond with simple gestures or verbally, and eliminates reading requirements. Results support the feasibility and validity of using a novel task to assess WM in individuals with and without aphasia.Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to (1) discuss the limitations of current working memory measures for individuals with aphasia; (2) describe how task design features of a new working memory task for people with aphasia address shortcomings of existing measures; (3) summarize the evidence supporting the validity of the novel working memory task. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Aphasia; Cognitive processing; Complex span tasks; Working memory; Working memory assessment","adult; aged; aphasia; Article; clinical article; comprehension; concurrent validity; controlled study; disease severity; female; human; intermethod comparison; language ability; language processing; male; mental performance; middle aged; modified listening span task; neuropsychological test; traditional listening span task; working memory; young adult; aphasia; attention; case control study; psychology; short term memory; Adult; Aged; Aphasia; Attention; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Young Adult",,"Elsevier Inc.",,,,,00219924,,JCDIA,"English","J.

Process mining is not limited to process discovery and also includes conformance checking and model enhancement. Conformance checking techniques are used to diagnose the deviations of the observed behavior as recorded in the event log from some process model. Model enhancement allows to extend process models using additional perspectives, conformance and performance information. In recent years, BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) 2.0 has become a de facto standard for modeling business processes in industry. This paper presents the BPMN support current in ProM. ProM is the most known and used open-source process mining framework. ProM's functionalities of discovering, analyzing and enhancing BPMN models are discussed. Support of the BPMN 2.0 standard will help ProM users to bridge the gap between formal models (such as Petri nets, causal nets and others) and process models used by practitioners.

The generalization of the fuzzy phonetic decoding method is proposed by assuming the distribution of the classified object to be of exponential type. Its preliminary phase includes association of each model object with the fuzzy set of model classes with grades of membership defined as the confusion probabilities estimated with the Kullback-Leibler divergence between model distributions. At first, each object (e.g., frame) in a classified sequence is put in correspondence with the fuzzy set which grades are defined as the posterior probabilities. Next, this fuzzy set is intersected with the fuzzy set corresponding to the nearest neighbor. Finally, the arithmetic mean of these fuzzy intersections is assigned to the decision for the whole sequence. In this paper we propose not to limit the method's usage with the Kullback-Leibler discrimination and to estimate the grades of membership of models and query objects based on an arbitrary distance with appropriate scale factor. The experimental results in the problem of isolated Russian vowel phonemes and words recognition for state-of-the-art measures of similarity are presented.

Questionnaires (specific and non-specific) are used to assess it. Objective: To validate the Russian version of the specific quality of life questionnaire ""NeuroQol"" in diabetic patients with peripheral polyneuropathy. Materials and Methods: A total of 371 diabetic patients participated in the study. All patients were screened for the signs of peripheral neuropathy and limb ischemia. The examination results were used to evaluate the eligibility of a patient; the eligible patients were then asked to fill in the quality of life questionnaire. The validation included translation, pilot testing and assessment of reliability and validity. Results: Cronbach's alpha coefficient of internal consistency exceeded 0.8 in all scales and proved the high reliability of the questionnaire. Criterion validity was analyzed by Spearmen correlation (r) coefficient between the domains and external parameters. The results obtained revealed significant correlation between NeuroQol domains and neuropathy severity, which indicates adequate criterion validity. The psychometric assessment (construct validity) was performed using factor analysis. The physical and psychosocial factors contributing to the quality of life were identified; they confirmed the validity of the questionnaire structure. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that the Russian version of the NeuroQol questionnaire is valid and reliable.

The lack of social life and psychological conditions of patients affect their quality of life more than physical complications do.

We argue that risk is not simply a feature of a financial product but a good in and of itself. Examining financial risk, we argue that it is most accurately typed as a common pool (particularly systemic risk) and so another approach to financial risk pricing is needed. We outline the basics of an ex-ante quasi-insurance fund to price financial risk. For more effective governance, risk-loving agents need to contribute to an ex-ante quasi-insurance fund. Insurance recipients would be risk-averse agents, who do not contribute, as they are forced to participate in systemic risk-taking against their preferences. Our approach to financial risk combines a microprudential regulatory framework with macroprudential supervision. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Bads; Common-pools; Goods; Insurance; Macroprudential supervision; Microprudential regulation; Risk; SIFI; Trader","Insurance; Risk management; Risks; Bads; Common-pools; Goods; Macroprudential supervision; Microprudential regulation; SIFI; Trader; Finance","Chinese Academy of Sciences, Research Center on FEDS;currexSole;Global Action Inc.;National Research University Higher School of Economics;University of Nebraska at Omaha;Yandex LLC","Elsevier B.V.","2nd International Conference on Information Technology and Quantitative Management, ITQM 2014","3 June 2014 through 5 June 2014","Moscow",105641,18770509,,,"English","Procedia Comput.

The changes at the industry level have been driven not only by the economic transition, but also by strategic choices of market players. These choices are linked to the intensity and nature of the intra-industry rivalry and fi nding a new balance of cooperation and competition in the industry. The study aims to contribute to the literature by providing a rich contextual understanding of the industry evolution over the transition period. We apply classic industry analysis to investigating the key driving forces of competition. On the other hand, we focus on the manner in which industry players select a governance mechanism, replacing the previous centrally planned system.

Using a stochastic frontier framework and data for 22 manufacturing sectors for 1996-2005, we find notable differences in technical efficiency between the three country groups we examine. We then investigate the effect of human capital and domestic R&D, proxied by the stock of patents, on technical efficiency.

An analysis of relationships between existential psychology (EP) and traditional mainstream psychology is focused on the issue of determinism versus self-determination; meaning as conceptualized in EP is treated as the key mechanism that can make a person to a large degree free from the rigid mechanisms of biological and social programming and open the new possibilities for action in the specifically human dimension. Meaning is relevant to humans rather than animals, to being-in-the-world rather than behaving-in-the-environment. The essence of meaning is treated as reference to a broader context; this is why meaning of any object cannot be found in this object as it is, but rather in the network of its relationships with broader contexts. The author’s multiregulation model of personality describes meaning-based regulation as one of the principal mechanisms of human activity regulation and specifies its interplay with other forms of regulation. Finally, meaning regulation is analyzed both theoretically and experimentally as an important resource of freedom, autonomy, and field-independence. It is experimentally shown that high level of meaning accounts for autonomous behavior in an unstructured boring situation and makes an opposition to helplessness. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.",,,,"Springer New York",,,,,,9781493903085; 9781493903078,,"English","Mean. in Posit. and Existential Psychology",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925517085

To develop this approach, the authors relied upon 1) results of numerous studies proving correlations between student performance and contextual factors (both in Russia and abroad); 2) foreign colleagues' experience of solving similar problems; and 3) the idea of providing minimum required information to enable such assessments in contemporary Russia. The fundamental idea lying behind the proposed assessment tool is that, having necessary data at hand, one can identify empirically stable correlations between student performance and contextual factors (e. g. different social composition of students). In research practice, these correlations were revealed through multiple regression analysis. Results of such analysis-established empirical correlations-may then be used to ""discount"" formal progress, i. e. to have justifiably higher expectations about institutions in more favorable contexts and lower expectations about those in less favorable situations. The authors think over two ways of using this information: based either on a formula or on a specific index (the index of school social well-being) they have elaborated. They also draw attention towards possible constraints associated with using these tools and touch upon a more global problem of considering contextual factors in assessing the quality of education in Russia.","Contextual data; Contextualization; Education quality; Quality assessment; Social composition of students; Social context; The Unified State Examination (USE)",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Exhibitors are primarily focused on business and contact development, whereas participants seek a unique experience and are motivated heavily by educational goals. Successful tradeshows will need to satisfy both of these complementary sets of goals. The effects of social media and mobile technology on tradeshows are noticeable but still in flux, as many shows increasingly use virtual methods for information exchange and contact development. Environmental sustainability has become important to both exhibitors and attendees, and budgetary constraints continue to be an issue.

An algorithm of construction of such a grid is proposed. This algorithm is based on correlation between the value of risk premium, the category of geological information about reserves (resources) and the class of geological complexity of mineral reserves (resources). Recurrent formulae are proposed for accurate calculation of risk premiums. As against the existing grids of risk premiums, the proposed model is based on mathematical calculation rather than on expert estimation of risk premiums. It helps reduce the impact of subjectivity. It also helps easily modify the grid if necessary. In addition, the proposed model takes into account the nonlinear growth of risk premiums with decrease of amount of information available about mineral reserves (resources). This nonlinearity is almost absent in the existing grids of risk premiums. The proposed grid of risk premiums is used as a basis for the evaluation method for economic effectiveness of geological exploration. This method takes into account not only the increase of mineral reserves (resources), but also the decrease of risk of the reserves appraisal and the decrease of risk premium. This method helps calculate additional economic effect that is neglected in the existing methods. The main inconvenience of the proposed unified grid of risk premiums is that it disregards specific features of mineral reserves that may have a great impact on risk evaluation. That is why the proposed method should be used at earlier stages of geological exploration when it is necessary to make decision about the use of mineral reserves (resources). A more precise evaluation of risk should include expert estimations.","Cost estimate of deposits; Discount rate; Estimation of actual reserves and undiscovered potential reserves of hard minerals; Geological-andeconomic appraisal of deposits; Risk premium",,,""Ore and Metals" Publishing house",,,,,00172278,,,"Russian","Gorn.

This paper examines whether these findings can be generalized to mobile web surveys. First, we explore the effect of scrolling versus paging design on the breakoff rate, item nonresponse, and completion time in mobile web surveys. Second, we investigate which type of invitation and reminder mode (SMS or e-mail) is more effective in terms of producing higher participation rates and maximizing the percentage of respondents who complete the survey via a mobile device rather than a PC. The paper summarizes the results of an experiment conducted among members of a volunteer online access panel in Russia, who were asked to complete the survey using a mobile device. We find that the scrolling design leads to significantly faster completion times, lower (though not significantly lower) breakoff rates, fewer technical problems, and higher subjective ratings of the questionnaire. We also find that SMS invitations are more effective than e-mail invitations in mobile web surveys. © 2014, American Association for Public Opinion Research.

Our results provide evidence for horizontal gender segregation across branches of the economy among labour market entrants in Russia, which have been growing since 1991. Moreover, horizontal differences seem to be driving vertical gender inequalities in terms of entry into authoritative positions. Accounting for heterogeneity in education and the entered branch, we find that despite gender equality principles and full-time employment for women, vertical gender inequalities had already existed under the Soviet regime. However, these increased during the liberalization reforms. These growing vertical gender inequalities can be traced back mainly to a worsening of female chances in an economic transition, whereas there was no significant change for male entrants. Furthermore, women seem to be particularly disadvantaged among highly qualified entrants. We conclude that Russian female entrants have not fully converted their educational advantage into occupational opportunities since the transition from socialism to a liberalized market economy. © 2015 The Author.

We have singled out four indicators of demand: a) student enrollment growth rate; b) expenses for research and development and for education; c) the age and rank distribution of current faculty in accordance with national retirement policies; and d) development of technology, emergence of new learning models, and the extent to which these models involve students and faculty. Fundamental factors affecting the supply include: 1) the national system's reliance on PhD production, and 2) status of post-graduate programs: whether they are the first step in academic career or only a preparatory phase. We have assessed efficiency of faculty recruitment based on openness of search and screening processes and the relative competition for new positions. We have found that the size of national systems in terms of students and staff has expanded considerably, while their proportion in national economies of the countries has remained almost the same. Demand driven by growth is relatively low in Europe, being constrained by ever lower accessibility of entry-level positions and by the job conditions offered there. Most countries - all except China and South Africa - tend to recruit faculty from newly degree graduates. Supply of PhDs (either native or foreign) is quite favorable, mostly due to female academics. The best part of the ten systems that we have analyzed stick to open competition principles when hiring faculty, but at least three systems (Russia, China, and India) apply a less open and competitive approach at all levels.","Academic degrees; Academic labor market; Demand for young faculty; International comparative studies; Post-graduate education; Supply of young faculty",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

The majority of current approaches either ignore real user and system runtime behavior or consider it only informally. This leads to a rather prescriptive top-down approach to software development. In this paper, we propose a bottom-up approach, which takes event logs (e.g., trace data) of a software system for the analysis of the user and system runtime behavior and for improving the software. We use well-established methods from the area of process mining for this analysis. Moreover, we suggest embedding process mining into the agile development lifecycle. The goal of this position paper is to motivate the need for foundational research in the area of software process mining (applying process mining to software analysis) by showing the relevance and listing open challenges. Our proposal is based on our experiences with analyzing a big productive touristic system.

Our main finding is that for the Russian market there is a strong connection between the volume of stocks and the structure of maximum cliques for all periods of observations. Namely, the most attractive Russian stocks have a strongest correlation between their returns.

They demonstrated its utility and discriminant validity through associations with attitudes and beliefs, but not with behaviors. We assess the discriminant and predictive validity of the theory by examining associations of each value with everyday behaviors in a Russian sample. Two hundred sixty-six respondents reported their values and the frequency with which they performed each of the 85 everyday behaviors during the past year. We derived indexes of 19 latent value factors and of 19 latent behavior factors using confirmatory factor analysis. A confirmatory multidimensional scaling analysis arrayed the values, excepting benevolence, on the circular motivational continuum of the theory. Structural equation modeling analyses supported the discriminant and predictive validity of the theory. Of the 19 values, 18 correlated more positively with the behavior chosen a priori as likely to express it than with any other behavior, and all values correlated negatively with behaviors chosen to express motivationally opposed values. The patterns of correlation between the values and behaviors approximated the sinusoid curve implied by the motivational continuum of values in almost all cases. The study suggests that the same motivational compatibilities and conflicts that structure value relations largely organize relations among value-expressive behaviors. The study examines moderation of value-behavior relations by gender and tests the normative pressure explanation of variation in the strength of value-behavior relations across value domains. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",,,,,00462772,,EJSPA,"English","Eur.

Intensity and efficiency of linkages is widely considered as one of the major determinants of innovation system performance. This paper presents empirical estimates of the scale and character of interactions between companies and research organisations in the Russian economy. The data are derived from the surveys of 1000 enterprises (2011) and 1000 research organisations (2012). The questionnaire is designed to allow characterization of cooperative practices and knowledge demand and supply. One of the key findings on the demand side is significant heterogeneity of involvement by sectors in the knowledge transfer process. Specific sectors (e.g. petrochemistry, equipment manufacturing) are tightly integrated with R&D institutions, while others (e.g. consumer goods, wood processing industries) are not linked to the Russian S&T development complex. This diversity of practices is partly determined by the overall allocation of resources within the economy as well as specific competition regimes that limit short- and medium-term benefits from R&D. Similarly, on the knowledge supply side, R&D organisations do not treat technology transfer as a priority strategy for sustainable development. Indeed, they focus on intellectual services instead of R&D, that is, on consulting and modification of existing technologies. Among innovation-active companies, only 14% rely on the R&D results of Russian research centers. Of those actually engaged in co-operation, 12% of companies indicate implementation of new-to-the-world products or production processes and 29% new-to-the-country innovations. Generally, low demand for R&D meets limited novelty of research results produced by the research organisations (compared to the technologies available on the global markets). Thus there are limited enclaves of efficient co-operation. These are mainly grouped around traditionally arranged institutional linkages as well as existing allocations of financial resources across the economic sectors.","Co-operation; Innovation; Innovation activities; Innovative enterprises; R and D transfer; Scientific organisations",,,"National Research University",,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902461043

Manufacturers are not completely aware of consumer needs; as a result, skilled users can improve products and suit them to their needs. Users best judge what will lead to commercial success, and they have long been recognized as a valuable source of knowledge to harvest for future innovation. Therefore, firms now involve customers in developing product ideas that are usable and valuable. The challenge is that valuable consumer-related knowledge is widely dispersed, and aggregating it is a complex and expensive task. However, the development of ICT opens up new possibilities, in particular, for innovation communities linking users with different needs and experiences. Interaction with users allows companies to integrate distributed knowledge, which gives the opportunity to improve the functionality and quality of the developed products. This paper analyses trends of user innovation development, their motivations to participate in innovation communities, the benefits that the company can gain from interaction with these communities, and the risks associated with a particular focus on the needs of a limited or overly wide range of consumers. It provides cases of user innovation in a number of sectors: software, hardware, construction, sports, medicine, fashion and design. The authors conclude that innovation communities are a powerful tool allowing integration of the dispersed knowledge of users into strategic decision making. The knowledge generation of inputs from innovation communities is facilitated by new analysis and data mining tools that make it easy to visualize and detect structures in virtual communication. The use of such instruments has large innovation potential if companies succeed in integrating real life conditions into technical innovations.","Communication technologies; Information; Innovation communities; Knowledge sharing; Lead users; Open innovation; User innovation",,,"National Research University",,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902505564

The grouping efficacy is the objective function for the CFP which simultaneously maximizes the number of intra-cell operations and minimizes the number of inter-cell operations. Currently there are no exact approaches (known to the authors) suggested for solving the CFP with the grouping efficacy objective. The only exact model which solves the CFP in a restricted formulation is due to Elbenani and Ferland (Cell formation problem solved exactly with the dinkelbach algorithm. Montreal. Quebec. CIRRELT-2012-07, 1–14, 2012). The restriction consists in fixing the number of production cells. The main difficulty of the CFP is the fractional objective function—the grouping efficacy.

We used this opportunity to study the decay of historic consonant alternations in Russian. In standard Russian, these alternations are present in some verb forms and in comparatives (e.g. suxoj 'dry' - sushe 'drier', ljubit' 'to love' - ljublju 'I love'), as well as before certain derivational suffixes. Verb forms have been recently studied by Slioussar and Kholodilova (2013), and we looked at comparatives. Two groups of adjectives were selected: ones that have normative comparatives with alternations and ones that do not, but native speakers still try to generate such forms. In the first group, some adjectives like ubogij 'poky' have up to 30 % of comparatives without alternations, but, unlike with verbs, no significant correlation with adjective frequency or its other characteristics was found. The second group consisted primarily of compound adjectives ending in -gij, -kij, -xij. Here, the most important factor is whether the second part of the compound is used as an independent adjective. If it is not (e.g. as in dlinnorukij 'long- Armed'), most comparatives lack alternations. Searching for forms on the Internet, we faced many problems. The counts provided by search engines are extremely inaccurate, only the first thousand results are shown, they cannot be downloaded in a convenient format, contain a lot of typos and other irrelevant data etc. We present a program called Lingui-Pingui that we developed to solve these and some other problems.","Comparative; Consonants; Historical alternations; Search optimization",,,"Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet",,,,,22217932,,,"Russian","Komp'ut.

We develop a conceptual game-theoretic framework that allows for the trusting partnership to have become equilibrium in a regulatory bargaining game with delegation. The monopoly service provider initiates a more cooperative relationship with regional authorities by offering a share in the joint venture. The latter being benevolent welfare maximiser either accepts or rejects the offer taking into account transportation market characteristics, local budget constraints, information structure, as well as socio-economic and political factors. Once the partnership is formed the private information of the parties is revealed and information rent is eliminated creating the room for welfare improvement. However, ex ante rational organisational choice to form a trusting partnership may not lead to welfare improvement ex post. In the extended model we consider how concessionary passengers and fare-dodgers affect the bargaining outcomes.

Thus simplifying process change management and the feedback cycle receives from application or process execution. Real-time business architecture approach is used as a high-level model and an extended variant of π-calculus is considered as a technical model.

We conducted an analysis of GCC and BRIC countries to show the different strategies leaders have taken to try and achieve this aspiration. This paper analyses the various aspects of national innovation systems of BRIC and GCC countries, highlights similar and different approaches and attempts to quantify their success. For example, GCC countries spend extensively on research and development (R&D), but have so far achieved less than meaningful results. Brazil, China and India are catching up to the acknowledged world leaders in innovation, but Russia is lagging. Design/methodology/approach - Our comparison was based mostly on secondary data from sources and institutions that use statistical data to build country rankings, such as the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) produced by the World Economic Forum. BRIC and GCC countries were analyzed over 1996-2011 because most of the indicators data are only available from 1996. Data related to intellectual property rights have been collected since 1999 or 2000. The data available for the number of researchers proved problematic for both BRIC and GCC countries. For instance, some data for the GCC countries was missing. To not leave a gap, we extrapolated in line with the overall trend; using the least squares method to approximate a straight line for the missing data based on what had already been reported. Findings - Counter-intuitively, we will argue that the push toward an innovation-based economy is actually not dependent on total expenditure on R&D, but rather relies on the efficient allocation of investments and the rigorous implementation of innovation strategy. And, we will demonstrate this by showing our ideas in relation to both BRIC and GCC countries. This analysis raises fascinating points of discussion for those looking to build an innovation economy in other countries and has practical implications for policy-makers and policy implementers in all countries.

Perceived societal values complement individuals' own values as influences on behavior. Aggregating these values across individuals would yield an additional latent index of societal value culture that is external to any individual mind. The level of institutions in my model points to the multiple, proximal cultures (e.g., ethnic, professional, religious, family) that influence individuals more directly than the societal value culture. I consider whether the degree of within-country consensus around values has increased in recent decades, eliminating the Fischer and Schwartz (2011) challege to 'shared-value' theories of culture. However, historical data suggest no increase in within-country consensus, so the challenge stands.

The article explores the ability of transformed institutions to limit the politicisation of energy and to reconcile the EU competitive-market approach with Russian state capitalism. More specifically, the article focuses on changes in intergovernmental, transgovernmental and transnational interactions. The article demonstrates that the gradual strengthening of transgovernmental and transnational institutions has inhibited the politicisation of energy relations and facilitated regulative cooperation between the EU and Russia. However, the potential of shared institutions is constrained by internal institutions on both sides. In Russia, these obstacles are insufficient top-down delegation of responsibilities in the government and its great power aspirations. In the EU, key barriers include inter-institutional rivalries, the EU's propensity to impose its legislation on external partners and the integration of energy policy with foreign policy. The article presents several policy implications. First, it is futile to institutionally impose the regulative paradigm of one partner on the other; rather, mutual dialogue is needed. Thus, institutions should be structured appropriately. Second, current depoliticisation will require the involvement of not only the EU and Russia but also transit countries, such as Ukraine. Third, transgovernmental and transnational cooperation should be nurtured because this is a useful channel for both information exchange and a regulative convergence of policy implementing mechanisms. Finally, this incremental regulative convergence is the only option available today for the EU and Russia; this is also a way to further depoliticise energy relations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy charter treaty; Energy dialogue; EU-Russian energy relations; Rational choice institutionalism; Transgovernmental; Transnational levels","Commerce; Laws and legislation; Public policy; Energy dialogue; Energy relations; Rational choice institutionalism; Transgovernmental; Transnational levels; Societies and institutions",,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,03014215,,ENPYA,"English","Energy Policy",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924111225

Design/methodology/approach: Core company's intangibles are combined into six intellectual capital (IC) elements that appear after the division of each of the traditional components (human, structural and relational capital (RC)). The human capital includes management and human resources capabilities (HRC). Structural capital is divided into innovation and internal process capabilities (IPC). RC contains networking capabilities and customer loyalty. In drawing on the relevant literature each element is described through a set of indicators collected from publicly available data. The validity of proposed IC model is justified through structural equation modeling. Each element is tested on a sample of more than 1,650 listed European companies over the period of 2004-2011. Findings: The study gives empirical support of three component IC structure and its decomposition into second level. The findings reveal that implementation of KM plays a significant role for HRC as well as for IPC. Research limitations/implications: The analysis was conducted for a particular sample that may restrict the conclusions. Practical implications: The proposed measurements for intangibles can be applied by any company for benchmarking and comparative analysis in KM.

High-energy Earth orbits that can be drastically modified with lunar swingbys and small propulsive maneuvers are used, especially near the collinear Sun-Earth and Earth-Moon libration points. The first human missions beyond low-Earth orbit may go to the vicinity of the translunar Earth-Moon libration point. This paper will concentrate on the next possible step, the first one into interplanetary space, that could be a one-year return mission to fly by a Near-Earth Object (NEO). Details are presented of a trajectory that leaves a halo orbit about the Earth-Moon L2 libration point, then uses three lunar swingbys and relatively small propulsive maneuvers to fly by the asteroid 1994 XL1, and return to the Earth-Moon L2 halo orbit for a ΔV of only 432 m/s. Next, rendezvous missions to some other NEO's will be presented. Finally, trajectories to reach Mars, first to Phobos or Deimos, will be outlined. The study uses highly-elliptical Earth orbits (HEOs) whose line of apsides can be rotated using lunar swingbys. The HEO provides a convenient and relatively fast location for rendezvous with crew, or to add propulsion or cargo modules, a technique that we call ""Phasing Orbit Rendezvous"".",,"Astrophysics; Computer software reusability; International cooperation; Interplanetary flight; Orbital transfer; Orbits; Human exploration; Human mission; International collaborations; Interplanetary space; Libration point; Low-Earth orbit; Near-Earth objects; Orbit rendezvous; Lunar missions","SAIC","American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.","AIAA/AAS Astrodynamics Specialist Conference 2014","4 August 2014 through 7 August 2014","San Diego, CA",106917,,9781624103087,,"English","AIAA/AAS Astrodynam.

At the level of a network element, forwarding decisions are defined by flows. To implement desired data properties during forwarding, a network operator imposes economic models by applying policies to flows. In real applications, the number of different policies is much smaller than the number of flows. In this work, we draw from our experience in classifier design for commercial systems and demonstrate how to share classifiers that represent policies between flows while still implementing them per flow per policy state. The resulting space saving is several orders of magnitude higher than any state-of-the art methods which reduce space of classifiers representation. © 2014 IEEE.","Packet classification; Service policies; TCAM","Classifier design; Commercial systems; Orders of magnitude; Packet classification; Real applications; Service policy; TCAM; Transport networks","IEEE Computer Society","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","22nd IEEE Annual Symposium on High-Performance Interconnects, HOTI 2014","26 August 2014 through 28 August 2014",,109437,,9781479958603,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Annu.

The model includes the equation describing the balance of forces acting on the Hall current region, as well as the relationship between the current of accelerated ions and the rate of working gas consumption. For fixed geometrical characteristics of a specific Hall thruster, this model allows one to interrelate the main integral characteristics of the thruster, such as the accelerating voltage, the magnetic field, the propellant flow rate, and the current of accelerated ions. The results of calculations for TAL-WSF/D-55-one of the most widely used Hall thrusters with an anode layer-are presented. The domain of existence of the discharge in the channel of the Hall thruster is analyzed.

Devices connected to the internet (internet of things), social interaction, mobile computing, and cloud computing provide new sources of event data and this trend will continue. The omnipresence of large amounts of event data is an important enabler for process mining. Process mining techniques can be used to discover, monitor and improve real processes by extracting knowledge from observed behavior. However, unprecedented volumes of event data also provide new challenges and often state-of-the-art process mining techniques cannot cope. This paper focuses on ""conformance checking in the large"" and presents a novel decomposition technique that partitions larger process models and event logs into smaller parts that can be analyzed independently. The so-called Single-Entry Single-Exit (SESE) decomposition not only helps to speed up conformance checking, but also provides improved diagnostics. The analyst can zoom in on the problematic parts of the process. Importantly, the conditions under which the conformance of the whole can be assessed by verifying the conformance of the SESE parts are described, which enables the decomposition and distribution of large conformance checking problems. All the techniques have been implemented in ProM, and experimental results are provided. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Conformance checking; Decomposition; Process diagnosis; Process mining","Decomposition; Internet of things; Conformance checking; Decomposition technique; Exponential growth; Large amounts; Process diagnosis; Process mining; Process model; Social interactions; Data mining",,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,03064379,,INSYD,"English","Inf.

Real-life processes can be effectively discovered, analyzed and optimized with the help of mature process mining techniques. There is a variety of process mining case studies and experience reports from such business areas as healthcare, public, transportation and education. Although nowadays, these techniques are mostly used for discovering business processes. The goal of this industrial paper is to show that process mining can be applied to software too. Here we present and analyze our experiences on applying process mining in different productive software systems used in the touristic domain. Process models and user interface workflows underlie the functional specifications of the systems we experiment with. When the systems are utilized, user interaction is recorded in event logs. After applying process mining methods to these logs, process and user interface flow models are automatically derived. These resulting models provide insight regarding the real usage of the software, motivate the changes in the functional specifications, enable usability improvements and software redesign. Thus, with the help of our examples we demonstrate that process mining facilitates new forms of software analysis. The user interaction with almost every software system can be mined in order to improve the software and to monitor and measure its real usage. © 2014 Authors.","client technology; process mining; software process mining; user interface design","Process mining; Software process; User interface designs","IEEE Software;Microsoft Research;Politecnico di Torino;Telecom Italia JOL (Joint Open Lab);Telecom Italia Lab","IEEE Computer Society","8th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement, ESEM 2014","18 September 2014 through 19 September 2014",,108081,19493770,9781450327749,,"English","Int.

That means we assume that a high frequency Markov chain runs in the background on a very fine time grid but that it is only observed on a coarser grid. This asymptotics reflects a set up occurring in the high frequency statistical analysis for financial data where diffusion approximations are used only for coarser time scales. In this paper, we show that under appropriate conditions the L1-distance between the joint distribution of the Markov chain and the distribution of the discretized diffusion limit converges to zero. The result implies that the LeCam deficiency distance between the statistical Markov experiment and its diffusion limit converges to zero. This result can be applied to Euler approximations for the joint distribution of diffusions observed at points Δ, 2Δ,..., nΔ. The joint distribution can be approximated by generating Euler approximations at the points Δk-1, 2Δk-1,..., nΔ.

Trajectory calculations of one-impulse Earth-halo orbit transfers with and without using a lunar gravitational maneuver are presented. For the calculation of one-impulse trajectories of Earth-halo-orbit transfers, an algorithm for constructing initial approximations is applied. These approximations are constructed by calculating and analyzing the isolines as a function of two variables. This function is represented by the pericenter height of the outgoing orbit over the Earth’s surface. The arguments of the function are special parameters that characterize the halo orbit. The mentioned algorithm allows one to obtain halo orbits with specified geometrical characteristics both in the ecliptic plane, and in the plane orthogonal to it. The estimates of the characteristic velocity expenses for maintaining SC in the selected halo orbit are obtained. The described technique was used to search for working orbits of the Spectr-RG and Millimetron spacecraft.

When someone provides feedback, for example by commenting on a note, or by replying to a message, the interaction is finalized. These interactions are asynchronous, i.e. they allow individuals to relate in different moments, whenever they have time to.

This finding is usually ascribed to the orienting of spatial attention to the cued location. Here we examine the role of perceptual merging of the two trial events in speeded target detection. That is, the cue and target may be perceived as a single event when they appear in the same location. If so, cueing effects could reflect, in part, the binding of the perceived target onset to the earlier cue onset. We observed the traditional facilitation of cued over uncued targets and asked the same observers to judge target onset time by noting the time on a clock when the target appeared. Observers consistently judged the onset time of the target as being earlier than it appeared with cued targets judged as earlier than uncued targets. When the event order is reversed so that the target precedes the cue, perceived onset is accurate in both cued and uncued locations. This pattern of results suggests that perceptual merging does occur in exogenous cueing. A modified attention account is discussed that proposes reentrant processing, evident through perceptual merging, as the underlying mechanism of reflexive orienting of attention. © 2014 ARVO.","Cueing; Perceptual merging; Re-entrant processing; Visual attention","article; association; attention; cueing; female; human; male; perceptual merging; physiology; psychomotor performance; re-entrant processing; reaction time; vision; visual attention; young adult; cueing; perceptual merging; re-entrant processing; visual attention; Attention; Cues; Female; Humans; Male; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Visual Perception; Young Adult",,"Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.",,,,,15347362,,,"English","J.

The effect of the long-range Coulomb repulsion in an ensemble of Dirac fermions on the formation of the superconducting pairing in a monolayer is studied in the framework of the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. The electronic structure of graphene is described in the strong coupling Wannier representation on the hexagonal lattice. We use the Shubin-Vonsowsky model which takes into account the intra- and intersite Coulomb repulsions of electrons. The Cooper instability is established by solving the Bethe-Salpeter integral equation, in which the role of the effective interaction is played by the renormalized scattering amplitude. The renormalized amplitude contains the Kohn-Luttinger polarization contributions up to and including the second-order terms in the Coulomb repulsion. We construct the superconductive phase diagram for the idealized graphene monolayer and show that the Kohn-Luttinger renormalizations and the intersite Coulomb repulsion significantly affect the interplay between the superconducting phases with f-, d+id-, and p+ip-wave symmetries of the order parameter. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","A.

The Lax operator is expressed in terms of the quantum non-dynamical R-matrix even at the classical level, where the Planck constant plays the role of the relativistic deformation parameter in the sense of Ruijsenaars and Schneider (RS). The integrable systems (relativistic tops) are described as multidimensional Euler tops, and the inertia tensors are written in terms of the quantum and classical R-matrices. A particular case of gl N system is gauge equivalent to the N-particle RS model while a generic top is related to the spin generalization of the RS model. The simple relation between quantum R-matrices and classical Lax operators is exploited in two ways. In the elliptic case we use the Belavin's quantum R-matrix to describe the relativistic classical tops. Also by the passage to the noncommutative torus we study the large N limit corresponding to the relativistic version of the nonlocal 2d elliptic hydrodynamics. Conversely, in the rational case we obtain a new gl N quantum rational non-dynamical R-matrix via the relativistic top, which we get in a different way - using the factorized form of the RS Lax operator and the classical Symplectic Hecke (gauge) transformation. In particular case of gl2 the quantum rational R-matrix is 11-vertex. It was previously found by Cherednik. At last, we describe the integrable spin chains and Gaudin models related to the obtained R-matrix. © 2014 The Author(s).","Gauge Symmetry; Integrable Equations in Physics; Quantum Groups",,,"Springer Verlag",,,,,11266708,,,"English","J.

IF represents an approach for bringing the future into holistic innovation processes, in which users and other stakeholders are systematically involved to detect future opportunities and risks. This could allow for a better integration of inclusive, long-term visions in decision-making and strategic thinking in the context of innovation. To be effective and enable mutual learning, the IF process calls for future-oriented, continuous interaction with current/anticipated users and a better integration of methods and approaches from different fields, including Foresight, user/market research and human-centred product design. This paper discusses two empirical studies that closely involved users in the exploration, imagination and creation of future TV experiences. Study 1 aimed to identify users' specific (future) needs and possible Lead User ideas concerning digital TV (DTV) in Flanders through an online survey (N= 11.802 digital TV users). 13 unique ideas representing important unfulfilled needs were identified and evaluated. Study 2, which focused on 'Future TV experiences', consisted of a multi-method research approach in three phases, resulting in six persona profiles, that help to provide an understanding of users' daily practices and futures aspirations. It is argued that a better introduction of future anticipation in inclusive innovation processes could enhance the input of users in innovation and contribute to the detection of potential user/societal needs and possible unexpected forms of use. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Future TV experiences; Innovation foresight; Interaction; User involvement; User practices","conceptual framework; decision making; detection method; future prospect; holistic approach; innovation; research work; stakeholder; strategic approach; television; Belgium; Flanders",,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,00163287,,,"English","Futures",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899057942

Previous research has shown that parents' religiosity matters less for the transmission of religious beliefs in devout than in secular nations, implying smaller costs of religious socialization. In this article we test which other societal factors affect the transmission of religious beliefs: anti-religious policies in formerly socialist countries, economic development, and income inequality. Our results indicate that societies with high levels of income inequality seem to provide the most favorable context for religious socialization. Individuals develop strong religious beliefs even if they only received little religious socialization within the family. Formerly socialist nations increased socialization costs through the overall suppression of religious practice. Economic development has no impact on socialization effects, suggesting that inequality is a more important driver of religious change than previously thought. © 2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.","Cross-national comparison; Inequality; Multilevel analysis; Religious beliefs; Religious socialization",,,"Wiley-Blackwell",,,,,00218294,,,"English","J.

The method of krokodil preparation may produce desomorphine as well as toxic reactants that cause extensive tissue necrosis. The first confirmed report of krokodil use in Russia took place in 2004. In 2012, reports of krokodil-related injection injuries began to appear beyond Russia in Western Europe and the United States. Objective: This exploratory study had two main objectives: (1) to determine if Internet search patterns could detect regularities in behavioral responses to Russian CCM policy at the population level, and (2) to determine if complementary data sources could explain the regularities we observed. Methods: First, we obtained krokodil-related search pattern data for each Russia subregion (oblast) between 2011 and 2012. Second, we analyzed several complementary data sources included krokodil-related court cases, and related search terms on both Google and Yandex to evaluate the characteristics of terms accompanying krokodil-related search queries. Results: In the 6 months preceding CCM sales restrictions, 21 of Russia's 83 oblasts had search rates higher than the national average (mean) of 16.67 searches per 100,000 population for terms associated with krokodil. In the 6 months following restrictions, mean national searches dropped to 9.65 per 100,000. Further, the number of oblasts recording a higher than average search rate dropped from 30 to 16. Second, we found krokodil-related court appearances were moderately positively correlated (Spearman correlation=.506, P≤.001) with behaviors consistent with an interest in the production and use of krokodil across Russia. Finally, Google Trends and Google and Yandex related terms suggested consistent public interest in the production and use of krokodil as well as for CCM as analgesic medication during the date range covered by this study. Conclusions: Illicit drug use data are generally regarded as difficult to obtain through traditional survey methods. Our analysis suggests it is plausible that Yandex search behavior served as a proxy for patterns of krokodil production and use during the date range we investigated. More generally, this study demonstrates the application of novel methods recently used by policy makers to both monitor illicit drug use and influence drug policy decision making.","Controlled substances; Designer drugs; Russia; Search engine; Street drugs; Surveillance","codeine; krokodil; morphine derivative; street drug; adult; analogs and derivatives; epidemiological monitoring; health care policy; health survey; human; Internet; male; Opioid-Related Disorders; procedures; Russian Federation; substance abuse; trends; United States; Adult; Codeine; Epidemiological Monitoring; Health Policy; Humans; Internet; Male; Morphine Derivatives; Opioid-Related Disorders; Public Health Surveillance; Russia; Street Drugs; Substance Abuse Detection; United States",,"Journal of Medical Internet Research",,,,,14388871,,,"English","J.

The role of stimulus parameters in completing a visual task (detecting changes) was investigated. The following parameters of visual stimuli varied in a chronometric experiment: the number of objects, their location in the stimulus space, and the shape of the objects (including a new object that attracts attention as well as various changes of single objects, such as appearance/disappearance, location shifts, changes of color and shape). The results of this study indicate that change blindness can have a different intensity (the time of detecting changes in flickering images) depending on the number of objects, their location in the stimulus space (structured or randomized), and the type of change (the most complicated one was a change of color): 1. The number of objects has considerable influence on the intensity of change blindness and is the most powerful parameter. 2. The shape of the objects within the image is not crucial for change-detection time. 3. The spatial organization of the objects is important for the successful detection of changes. The changes are detected quicker in images with regular rather than random organization. 4. A distraction (in this case, a word that was substituted for an object) doesn't have any considerable influence on change detection. 5. Change-detection time increases as the interstimulus interval increases from 200 to 400 ms. 6. The detection of shifts and of appearance/disappearance is quicker than the detection of color change. These results let us create stimulus patterns for change-blindness experiments that differ in complexity, and thus we could examine a wide range of hypotheses about the function of the psychological mechanisms of spatial attention that are used to explain this phenomenon. © Lomonosov Moscow State University, 2014. © Russian Psychological Society, 2014.","Change blindness; Spatial attention; Stimulus determinants",,,"Russsian Psychological Society",,,,,20746857,,,"English","Psychol.

To achieve this analytical goal, it develops and applies five criteria of good deliberation. The analysis suggests that the public policy process in China is now more inclusive and pluralistic than it was in the past.

Our study is the first step towards the 'smart' evaluation tool which would introduce linguistically relevant criteria to evaluation; be able to put the mistakes on a scale from minor to critical ones; make evaluation easier in case the grid of roles varies. We run an experiment based on the data from the Russian FrameBank, a FrameNet-oriented open access database which includes a dictionary of Russian lexical constructions and a corpus of tagged examples. The semantic role is one of the parameters that define the predicate- Argument patterns in FrameBank. The inventory of roles is modeled hierarchically and forms a graph. We explore the cases when the role induced by the system and the answer of the gold standard do not match. We analyze the statistical criteria of distribution of roles in the patterns and the distance between the source and the target in the graph of roles as a mean to assess the goodness of fit.","Constructions; Corpus linguistics; Evaluation; Lexical resources; Polysemy; Semantic role labeling; Semantic roles",,,"Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet",,,,,22217932,,,"English","Komp'ut.

In the case where the utility function is finite on ℝ, we use the approach, suggested by Biagini and Frittelli, based on using an Orlicz space constructed from an investor’s utility function. We reduce the original problem to an optimization problem in this space in a nontrivial way, which allows us to weaken essentially assumptions on the model. We also study the problem of utility maximization with random endowment considered by Cvitanić, Schachermayer, and Wang. Using the space ψL∞ with a weight function ψ constructed from a random endowment permits us to consider unbounded random endowments. Another important contribution is that in both problems under consideration, we provide versions of the dual problem that are free of singular functionals. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",,,,"Springer International Publishing",,,,,19316828,,,"English","Springer Optim.

We seek to show how various characteristics of American society and the US economy are related to this phenomenon. We illustrate some structural features of the US economy and public policies that may have created a difference, in terms of patterns of consumption and market participation, between the USA and continental Europe. We then present some explanations of US hyperconsumerism put forward by psychologists and sociologists, thus relating this phenomenon to the decline in subjective well-being and social capital documented in the USA. We also discuss how the negative endogenous growth paradigm may help to account for it. Finally, we review the debate on the US policy agenda by underlining some weaknesses in the two politically more realistic options and by outlining a third policy strategy, which is possibly preferable for people's long-term well-being. © The Author 2014.

Contrary to this traditional narrative, we argue that as governments increased state capacity, they often strove to weaken the autarkic tendencies of regional laws, thereby promoting greater trade and a more integrated market. To show this, we exploit a quasi-natural experiment generated in the French wine industry by a law implemented on 1 January 1901 which lowered and harmonized various local tax rates.We demonstrate that high internal taxes on wine, set by regional governments, discouraged trade and protected small producers of expensive and low quality wines.

Confirmatory factor analysis supported a theoretical model with seven scales, including three scales measuring types of intrinsic motivation (intrinsic cognition, achievement, and personal growth), three scales measuring extrinsic motivation (motivation for self-respect, introjected, and external regulation), and an amotivation scale.

Starting from the assumption that childbearing decisions also depend on uncertainty about future employment, income, and wealth, we empirically assess how fertility intentions are affected by job instability, which may severely compromise the employment stability of workers, and economic disadvantages in terms of household income and wealth, which may imply insufficient means to deal with potential adverse future events, thereby generating in the household feelings of anxiety and economic insecurity. We show that the instability of women's work status (i.e., the holding of occasional and precarious jobs) significantly discourages the decision to attempt having a first child. Low levels of household wealth significantly and positively influence the decision to postpone attempting a first child. The chances of further childbirth are significantly and negatively influenced by household income insecurity. © 2013 International Association for Research in Income and Wealth.","C25; Childbearing; Economic insecurity; Employment instability; Fertility; Income; Italy; J13; Precarious employment; Wealth",,,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",,,,,00346586,,,"English","Rev.

The initial experiments based on the coexistence of a normal phase and a superconducting phase in the intermediate state led to the concept itself. It was followed by a focus on geometrically inhomogeneous systems like point contacts, which provided a very clear manifestation of the energy and direction dependence of the Andreev reflection process. The point contacts have recently evolved towards the atomic scale owing to the use of mechanical break-junctions, revealing a very detailed dependence of Andreev reflection on the macroscopic phase of the superconducting state. In present-day research, the superconducting in homogeneity is constructed by clean room technology and combines superconducting materials, for example, with low-dimensional materials and topological insulators. Alternatively, the superconductor is combined with nano-objects, such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, or semiconducting nanowires.

An ethology is a study of an animal in its natural environment, and here we examine the fixation patterns of the human animal searching a series of challenging illustrated scenes that are well-known in popular culture. The search was free of secondary tasks, probes, and other distractions. Our goal was to describe saccadic behavior, including patterns of fixation duration, saccade amplitude, and angular direction. In particular, we employed both new and established techniques for identifying top-down strategies, any influences of bottom-up image salience, and the midlevel attentional effects of saccadic momentum and inhibition of return. The visual search dynamics that we observed and quantified demonstrate that saccades are not independently generated and incorporate distinct influences from strategy, salience, and attention.

This problem is known as the longest common substring (LCS) problem and has a classic O(n) space and O(n) time solution (Weiner [FOCS'73], Hui [CPM'92]). However, the use of linear space is impractical in many applications. In this paper we show that for any trade-off parameter 1≤τ≤;n, the LCS problem can be solved in O(τ) space and time O(n2/τ), thus providing the first smooth deterministic time-space trade-off from constant to linear space. The result uses a new and very simple algorithm, which computes a τ-additive approximation to the LCS in O(n2/τ) time and O(1) space. We also show a time-space trade-off lower bound for deterministic branching programs, which implies that any deterministic RAM algorithm solving the LCS problem on documents from a sufficiently large alphabet in O(τ) space must ω (n√ log(n/(τ log n))/ log log(n/(τ log n)) use time. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Approximation algorithms; Branching programs; Large alphabets; Linear spaces; Longest common substring; Lower bounds; SIMPLE algorithm; Space algorithms; Space and time; Problem solving","","Springer Verlag","22nd Annual European Symposium on Algorithms, ESA 2014","8 September 2014 through 10 September 2014","Wroclaw",107158,03029743,9783662447765,,"English","Lect.

Traditional multi-field classification approaches, in both software and ternary content-addressable memory (TCAMs), entail tradeoffs between (memory) space and (lookup) time. TCAMs cannot efficiently represent range rules, a common class of classification rules confining values of packet fields to given ranges. The exponential space growth of TCAM entries relative to the number of fields is exacerbated when multiple fields contain ranges. In this work, we present a novel approach which identifies properties of many classifiers which can be implemented in linear space and with worst-case guaranteed logarithmic time and allows the addition of more fields including range constraints without impacting space and time complexities. On real-life classifiers from Cisco Systems and additional classifiers from ClassBench (with real parameters), 90-95% of rules are thus handled, and the other 5-10% of rules can be stored in TCAM to be processed in parallel. © 2014 ACM.","packet classification; TCAM","Convolutional codes; Packet networks; Classification approach; Classification rules; Logarithmic time; Packet classification; Range constraints; Space and time complexity; TCAM; Ternary content addressable memory; Ternary content adressable memory","ACM SIGCOMM","Association for Computing Machinery","2014 ACM Conference on Special Interest Group on Data Communication, SIGCOMM 2014","17 August 2014 through 22 August 2014","Chicago, IL",107336,,9781450328364,,"English","SIGCOMM - Proc.

This is especially true in cooperative environments relying heavily on human knowledge. Declarative languages, like Declare, alleviate this issue by not describing what to do step-by-step but by defining a set of constraints between actions that must not be violated during the process execution. Furthermore, in modern cooperative business, time is of utmost importance. Therefore, declarative process models should be able to take this dimension into consideration. Timed Declare has already previously been introduced to monitor temporal constraints at runtime, but it has until now only been possible to provide an alert when a constraint has already been violated without the possibility of foreseeing and avoiding such violations. In this paper, we introduce an extended version of Timed Declare with a formal timed semantics for the entire language. The semantics degenerates to the untimed semantics in the expected way. We also introduce a translation to timed automata, which allows us to detect inconsistencies in models prior to execution and to early detect that a certain task is time sensitive. This means that either the task cannot be executed after a deadline (or before a latency), or that constraints are violated unless it is executed before (or after) a certain time. This makes it possible to use declarative process models to provide a priori guidance instead of just a posteriori detecting that an execution is invalid. We also outline how a Declare model with time can be used in resource planning and how Declare has been integrated into CPN Tools. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Declarative process modeling; Declare; error detection; metric temporal logic; operational support; planning; timed automata",,,"World Scientific Publishing Co.

They have two parameters. The limit of the first one brings the model to the ordinary rational KZ equation. Another one is т. At the level of classical mechanics the deformation parameter т allows to extend the previously obtained modified Gaudin models to the modified Schlesinger systems. Next, we notice that the identities underlying generic (elliptic) KZB equations follow from some additional relations for the properly normalized R-matrices. The relations are noncommutative analogues of identities for (scalar) elliptic functions. The simplest one is the unitarity condition. The quadratic (in R matrices) relations are generated by noncommutative Fay identities. In particular, one can derive the quantum Yang-Baxter equations from the Fay identities. The cubic relations provide identities for the KZB equations as well as quadratic relations for the classical r-matrices which can be treated as halves of the classical Yang-Baxter equation. At last we discuss the R-matrix valued linear problems which provide gl^ CM models and Painleve equations via the above mentioned identities. The role of the spectral parameter plays the Planck constant of the quantum R-matrix. When the quantum glw R-matrix is scalar (N = 1) the linear problem reproduces the Krichever's ansatz for the Lax matrices with spectral parameter for the gl^ CM models. The linear problems for the quantum CM models generalize the KZ equations in the same way as the Lax pairs with spectral parameter generalize those without it. © The Authors.","Gauge Symmetry; Integrable Equations In Physics; Quantum Groups",,,"Springer Verlag",,,,,11266708,,,"English","J.

Visit of the Arctic Research Institute in Leningrad in 1934 further enhanced Ahlmann's sympathy and in 1935 he co-founded the Society for the Promotion of Cultural and Scientific Relations between Sweden and the Soviet Union. After further wartime collaboration, Ahlmann returned to the Soviet Union in 1958 and 1960 as president of the International Union of Geographical Sciences. Using his longtime Soviet contacts to penetrate the Iron Curtain, Ahlmann became a key figure in maintaining the flow of scientific information between East and West. New materials from archives open perspectives for better understanding of the international connections and transfer of knowledge in geophysical and geographical science in its formative period.

The study is empirical in nature; the theoretical framework is based on the principles of the new economic geography. The analysis shows that, despite the high level of spatial concentration of economic activity, the agglomeration processes tend to continue. The factors the dynamics of spatial differences within the oblast are the size of the local markets and the intensity of relationships between market agents. At the same time the interactions between different municipal districts within the oblast are dominated by negative effects; the districts are adversely affected by the proximity to Novosibirsk, a city with a large economy. The patterns identified in the study provide evidence of a very likely increase in the polarization of Novosibirsk oblast. The processes and relationships that underlie the agglomeration tendencies in the territory are based on technological and market factors, such as increasing returns to scale of economic activity and imperfect competition in regional markets. The market transformations in Russia have strengthened the role and influence of these factors. Thus, despite the continued interest from the oblast administration toward territorial development and their vigorous redistribution policy, there are no signs of a decrease in spatial differences across the oblast. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2014.

The results show that gender parity is far from being achieved. Women remain underrepresented in terms of their contribution to research output and scientific impact in almost all disciplines, with Mathematics and Physics, research areas in which Russia is specialized, having the largest gap. Men and women show different collaboration patterns on the national and international level, whereas women are preeminent on the national scene, men are on the international one. Although the impact of women’s scientific output significantly increases after the fall of the USSR, the gap between both genders remains stable over time for most of the disciplines. As a result, this increase cannot be interpreted as an improvement of the women’s relative influence in Russian science, but rather an improvement of Russian science impact in general. © 2014, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Collaboration; Gender; Research impact; Research productivity; Russia",,,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",,,,,01389130,,,"English","Scientometrics",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939871347

We propose that this dramatic migration was rooted in institutional changes initiated by the 1906 Stolypin land titling reform. One might expect better property rights to decrease the propensity to migrate by improving economic conditions in the reform area. However, this titling reform increased land liquidity and actually promoted migration by easing financial constraints and decreasing opportunity costs. Treating the reform as a quasi-natural experiment, we employ difference-in-differences analysis on a panel of province-level data that describe migration and economic conditions. We find that the reform had a sizeable effect on migration. To verify the land liquidity effect, we exploit variation in the number of households participating in the reform. This direct measure of the reform mechanism estimates that land liquidity explains approximately 18% of migration during this period. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Land liquidity; Land titles; Migration; Property rights; Stolypin","economic conditions; economic history; historical geography; historical perspective; internal migration; land market; land reform; planning history; property rights; resettlement policy; twentieth century; Russian Federation",,"Elsevier",,,,,03043878,,,"English","J.

That is true even for massive fields. Our main concern is the interrelation between these infrared effects, the invariance of the QFT under the dS isometry and the (in)stability of dS invariant states (and of dS space itself) under nonsymmetric perturbations. © World Scientific Publishing Company.","de Sitter space; particle creation; quantum fields in curved spacetime",,,,,,,,02182718,,,"English","Int.

But these have all been in relatively low circular ""Low-Earth"" orbits (LEO) that have relatively long revisit times over a given area. This paper will describe a set of satellites in Molniya orbits with apogees above areas of interest continuously taking general images of large portions of the whole Earth's surface with low resolution (on the order of 1 km), thus monitoring the overall state of the surface. When required, for example, if a forest fire has been identified, a sensor with much higher resolution can be pointed at the area of study. We will consider the requirements for the spacecraft in Molniya orbits for general monitoring of the Earth's surface, especially the northern forests of Russia, Canada, and other northern countries. The 12-hour Molniya orbits at the critical inclination of 63.4 deg will have a perigee height around 300 km with an argument of perigee of -90 deg.; then the apogee height (where the spacecraft spend most of their time) will be about 40,000 km, similar to the distance to a geosynchronous spacecraft, over the northernmost latitude of the orbit, 63.4 deg. A total of four spacecraft, with two of them in each of two orbit planes with their longitude of ascending node 180 deg. apart, will give good coverage of all of the northern regions, since there will always be two satellites near apogee over longitudes 180 deg. apart. But twice a year, all of the orbits will be near the Earth's terminator, with poor illumination for visual images. To avoid this problem, six satellites are needed, two each in three orbit planes with longitudes of ascending node separated by 120 deg. One satellite in each orbit (total of 3) is possible; with proper phasing, two of the spacecraft would be close enough to apogee most of the time for good coverage of most areas of interest. Results will be presented for launch windows that avoid decreasing perigee heights caused by lunisolar perturbations. Also, realistic force models show that the longitudes of ascending node, and thus the sub-Earth apogee points, drift from their initial positions. A strategy will be presented for minimizing the total delta-V for stationkeeping maneuvers needed to counter-act the longitude drift.

A single slot is a time span that can be assigned to a task, which is a part of a job. The job launch requires a co-allocation of a specified number of slots starting synchronously. The challenge is that slots associated with different resources of distributed computational environments may have arbitrary start and finish points that do not match. Some existing algorithms assign a job to the first set of slots matching the resource request without any optimization (the first fit type), while other approaches are based on an exhaustive search. In our approach, co-allocation strategies formalized by given criteria are implemented by algorithms of linear complexity on an available slots number. The novelty of the approach consists of allocating alternative sets of dynamically updated slots based on the information from local resource managers in the node domains. It provides possibilities to optimize job scheduling during resource selection. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",,,,"Springer Verlag",,,,,1860949X,9783319015705,,"English","Stud.

Competition for resource reservation between independent users, local and global job flows substantially complicates scheduling and the requirement to provide the necessary quality of service. A meta-scheduling model, justified in this work, assumes a complex combination of job flow dispatching and application-level scheduling methods for jobs, as well as resource sharing and consumption policies established in virtual organizations (VOs) and based on economic principles.

This leads to cost savings associated with reduced bandwidth utilization, which results from a decrease in data duplication across network links. An important problem on multicast networks, known as the delay constrained multicast routing problem (DCMRP), asks for the determination of an optimal route for packet transfers between members of a multicast group. Several heuristics have been proposed in the last few years to solve the DCMRP, which is of great interest for telecommunication engineers. In this paper we propose a novel, hybrid metaheuristic approach for the DCMRP, where a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure is used along with variable neighborhood search algorithm to find near optimal solutions.

We suppose that the forward equation depends on some finite-dimensional unknown parameter. We consider the problem of estimating this parameter and then use the proposed estimator to estimate the solution of the BSDE. This last estimator is constructed with the help of the solution of the corresponding partial differential equation. We are interested in three observation models admitting a consistent estimation of the unknown parameter: small noise, large samples and unknown volatility. In the first two cases we have a continuous time observation, and the unknown parameter is in the drift coefficient. In the third case the volatility of the forward equation depends on the unknown parameter, and we have discrete time observations.

The influence of the counterpropagating leaders on the process of the lightning strike of ground-based and insulated objects is discussed. In the first case, the upward negative leader is initiated by the positive downward leader, which propagates from the high-voltage electrode of the ""rod-rod""-type Marx generator (the rod is located on the plane and is 3-m high) in the gap with a length of 9-12 m. The positive-voltage pulse with a duration of 7500 μs had an amplitude of up to 3 MV. In the second case, initiation of the positive upward leader was performed in the electric field created by a cloud of negatively charged aerosol, which simulates the charged thunderstorm cell. In this case, all the phases characteristic of the ascending lightnings initiated by the tall ground-based objects and the triggered lightnings during the experiments with an actual thunderstorm cloud were observed in the forming spark discharge with a length of 1.5- 2.0 m.

In games from both classes, payoff functions of the players are sums of linear functions of vector arguments or those of linear ones and a bilinear function. Games from the first class are those in which player strategies are connected, i.e., they cannot be chosen by the players independently, whereas player strategies in games from the second class are disjoint. For the games from both classes either sufficient or necessary and sufficient conditions of the equilibriums are provided, and these conditions allow one to calculate the equilibriums by effective optimization techniques. This fact contributes to making the equilibrium concept a productive approach to quantitatively analyzing conflicts in systems economic studies. Economic problems that appear in systems described by nonlinear mathematical models with linear constraints, in particular, by some network models, including (a) restructuring a company and positioning the restructured company in a market or in several markets, (b) forming a pool of regional clients interested in selling their products and in buying somebody else’s ones outside their regions via forward contracts offered by regional brokers, (c) determining initial prices for procurement contracts to be tendered by a public administration, (d) finding competitive transportation tariffs by a railroad company competing with tracking companies for providing transportation services both in a region and between two regions, (e) calculating an optimal volume of producing electricity by a base load power plant in a part of a country’s electrical grid under an uncertain demand in the corresponding network of the grid customers, and (f) forming a public-private partnership to develop a set of projects that a public administration needs to develop and implement, but does not have funds to finance on its own (partly or even completely) are discussed to illustrate how the games under consideration appear, and how they can be analyzed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",,,,"Springer International Publishing",,,,,19316828,,,"English","Springer Optim.

In fact, for him, it serves as a synonym for the normal state of society, while absence of it is a deviation from that normal state, or social pathology. The theme of solidarity permeates all his work. His first course of lectures at the University of Bordeaux, read in the years 1887-1888, was not by chance called “Social Solidarity,""1 while his doctoral thesis (1893) was devoted to the demonstration of the basic role of the division of labor in building, maintaining, and reinforcing social solidarity (Durkheim [1984] 1997). It is true that Durkheim gradually moved away from the word “solidarity,"" probably due to its massive use outside social science and the thinker’s unwillingness to become a victim of the idols of the marketplace or those of the theatre. Moreover, the word is hardly ever used in the scientific texts of the members of his school. His faithful disciple and nephew Marcel Mauss in his two well-known texts of 1931 and 1934, “Social Cohesion in Polysegmentary Societies” (Mauss 1969a) and “Fragment of a Plan of General Descriptive Sociology” (Mauss 1969b), prefers to speak of “social cohesion” and not of “solidarity,"" only briefly mentioning the two Durkheimian types of the latter in the second of these texts.2 Nevertheless, until the end of his life, even when Durkheim did not actually use the word “solidarity,"" he anyway researched and tried to substantiate the phenomenon in question. © Vincent Jeffries, 2014.",,,,"Palgrave Macmillan",,,,,,9781137391865; 9781137391841,,"English","The Palgrave Handb. of Altruism, Moral., and Soc.

The converb of this verb (manan) is desemantisized, it loses the syntactic properties of the verb of speech and shifts to the category of subordinators. Successive grammaticalization steps of this marker can be observed in Modern Mari: in some contexts it functions as a quotation marker, while in others as a subordinator. We suggest two paths of grammaticalization of this form on the basis of the given analysis: the first path involves the context of verbs of speech, mental and emotive complementtaking predicates, the second path involves the contexts of causation and potential situation (in complementation), purpose and causal adverbial clauses. The argumentation for this grammaticalization pattern is based on the constraints on subordinate predicate encoding (acceptability of non-finite clauses with manan), the choice of pronouns [we focus on the choice of the anaphoric vs. deictic strategy of encoding the textual («original» in [Aikhenvald 2008]) speaker and hearer] and the mood of the verb in the complement clause. We show that in Modern Mari the analyzed form can have the following functions: as a quotation marker, as a subordinator in complement and adverbial clauses, as a discourse marker of hesitation and autocorrection, and as a semantically empty subordinator that is used to express negation with the infinitive.","Anaphora; Complementation; Complementizer; Conjunction; Deixis; Grammaticalization; Infinitive; Mari; Subordination; Subordinator; Verbs of speech",,,"Izdatel'stvo Nauka",,,,,0373658X,,,"Russian","Vopr.

The present study is devoted to the explanation of the basic principles of the algorithm operation and also to the description of its modifications intended for solving the problem of detection of faces in a dense crowd. In this study, in addition to the stochastic algorithm, we introduce a new detector for detection of fuzzy faces in the images, which is based on the same energy function that we use in the stochastic approach. © 2014 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",,"Algorithms; Computer vision; Detectors; Stochastic systems; Algorithm operation; Basic principles; Digital photographic cameras; Energy functions; Fuzzy boundary; Number of peoples; Stochastic algorithms; Stochastic approach; Problem solving",,"Maik Nauka-Interperiodica Publishing",,,,,10642269,,JTELE,"English","J.

To avoid these phenomena, various Representation learning algorithms are used as a first key step in solutions of these tasks to transform the original high-dimensional data into their lower-dimensional representations so that as much information about the original data required for the considered Data Mining task is preserved as possible. The above Representation learning problems are formulated as various Dimensionality Reduction problems (Sample Embedding, Data Manifold embedding, Manifold Learning and newly proposed Tangent Bundle Manifold Learning) which are motivated by various Data Mining tasks.

However, the nature of the phenomenon, as well as its interaction with other brain functions has not been fully understood. Therefore, the study of brain peculiarities of left- and right-handed subjects by neuronal network analysis is of particular interest. The aim of the investigation was to analyze brain network structures according to electroencephalography findings in left- and right-handed subjects in resting state and during cognitive testing (memorizing) using a graph theory. Materials and Methods. 44 volunteers (20 left-handed, 24 right-handed) took part in the experiment. We used three techniques to calculate the degree of spatial synchronization of EEG-signals: coherence, an imaginary part of coherence, and synchronization likelihood. On basis of the obtained graphs we built minimum spanning trees (MST) and calculated some of their characteristics. Results. Left-handers compared to right-handers were found to have more linear MST in theta band (coherence-based MST). Memorizing was characterized by the increase of MST regularity structure in alpha band for all three signal measures (coherence, an imaginary part of coherence, and synchronization likelihood). And only right-handers showed the increase in regularity for MST built on the basis of synchronization likelihood and imaginary part of coherence. Regularity increase in alpha band for coherence-based MST was not associated with handedness. Thus, MST based on synchronization likelihood and an imaginary part of coherence are more sensitive to differences between left- and right-handers during memorizing.","Brain functional relationship; Electroencephalography; Graph theory; Hand preference; Minimum spanning tree; Neuronal network","adult; article; brain asymmetry; cognition; connectome; electroencephalograph electrode; electroencephalography phase synchronization; female; frequency modulation; functional neuroimaging; handedness; human; human experiment; hypothalamus; independent component analysis; information processing; left handedness; male; mathematical analysis; medical ethics; memory; minimum spanning tree; nerve cell network; post hoc analysis; psychomotor performance; questionnaire; resting state network; right handedness; young adult",,"Nizhny Novgorod State Medical Academy",,,,,20764243,,,"English","Sovrem.

We use the Schwinger-Keldysh diagrammatic technique. We observe that photon’s Keldysh propagator receives growing with time infrared contribution. As the result, loop corrections are not suppressed in comparison with tree-level contribution. This effect substantially changes the standard picture of the pair production. To sum up leading IR corrections from all loops we consider the infrared limit of the Dyson-Schwinger equations and reduce them to a single kinetic equation. © 2014, The Author(s).","Nonperturbative Effects; Thermal Field Theory",,,"Springer Verlag",,,,,11266708,,,"English","J.

The study of power in the two communities focused on two major themes: (1) the composition of influential actors and institutions and the power hierarchy; (2) relationships between them and coalition building. The discovered configuration of actors and relationships between them demonstrate, on the one hand, quite a lot in common with European and North American communities, on the other hand, a number of features that reflect the systemic and institutional properties of Russian politics and society. The social base of the local power structure is very narrow. The local elite composed of the heads of the executive, business leaders, and the most influential representatives of urban and district legislatures actually holds all the power in the local community, having no serious opponents or a real alternative in the foreseeable future. This power structure is supported by informal institutions and personal relationships within the elite and between the elite and those who are forced to accept the existing system of relations; it allows them to successfully protect their personal and/or corporate interests. A wide range of opportunities to use official position and/or relationships with public officials for personal enrichment stimulates the formation of various kinds of coalitions for the furtherment of the personal interests of its members. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","local elites; local politics; power; Russian politics; urban communities; urban regimes",,,"Routledge",,,,,2158379X,,,"English","J.

Similar to the results reported in previous studies from other countries, industry sector of the company making the IT investment has little effect on the market reaction. Also similar to the results reported from the USA, the Russian stock market seems to respond more positively to innovative IT investments than to non-innovative investments.

The bundles are classified by their characteristic classes, which are elements of the second cohomology group H2(στ ,ℒ(G)), where ℒ(G) is the centre of G. For any complex simple Lie group G and any characteristic class the moduli space of flat connections is defined, and for them the monodromy-preserving deformation equations are given in Hamiltonian form together with the corresponding Lax representation. In particular, they include the Painlevé VI equation, its multicomponent generalizations, and the elliptic Schlesinger equations. The general construction is described for punctured complex curves of arbitrary genus. The Drinfeld.Simpson (double coset) description of the moduli space of Higgs bundles is generalized to the case of the space of flat connections. This local description makes it possible to establish the Symplectic Hecke Correspondence for a wide class of monodromy-preserving problems classified by the characteristic classes of the underlying bundles. In particular, the Painlevé VI equation can be described in terms of SL(2)-bundles. Since ℒ(SL(2)) = Z2, the Painlevé VI equation has two representations related by the Hecke transformation: 1) as the well-known elliptic form of the Painlevé VI equation (for trivial bundles); 2) as the non-autonomous Zhukovsky.Volterra gyrostat (for non-trivial bundles). © 2014 Russian Academy of Sciences (DoM), London Mathematical Society, Turpion Ltd.","Flat connections; Higgs bundles; Monodromy-preserving deformations; Painlevé equations; Schlesinger systems",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing",,,,,00360279,,,"English","Russ.

Nowadays, it is trivial to visualize a molecular surface and surface-distributed properties in three-dimensional space. However, such a representation trends to be biased and ambiguous in case of thorough analysis. We present a new method to create 2D spherical projection maps of entire protein surfaces and manipulate with them-protein surface topography (PST). It permits visualization and thoughtful analysis of surface properties. PST helps to easily portray conformational transitions, analyze proteins' properties and their dynamic behavior, improve docking performance, and reveal common patterns and dissimilarities in molecular surfaces of related bioactive peptides. This paper describes basic usage of PST with an example of small G-proteins conformational transitions, mapping of caspase-1 intersubunit interface, and intrinsic ""complementarity"" in the conotoxin-acetylcholine binding protein complex.

This assumption is certainly not true for all the words extracted in this way; for that reason, we manually filtered the automatically obtained list in order to exclude non-Russian or incorrectly lemmatized words, as well as words recorded by other dictionaries or those occurring in pre-2000 texts from the Russian National Corpus (http://www.ruscorpora.ru). The result is a list of 168 words that can potentially be considered neologisms. We present an attempt at an etymological classification of these neologisms (unsurprisingly, most of them have recently been borrowed from English, but there are also quite a few new words composed of previously borrowed stems) and identify various derivational patterns. We also classify words into several large thematic areas, ""internet"", ""marketing"", and ""multimedia"" being among those with the largest number of words. We consider our results preliminary, but believe that, together with the word base collected in the process, they can serve as a starting point in further studies of neologisms and lexical processes that lead to their acceptance into the mainstream language.","Derivation; Loan word; Neologism; Non-vocabulary; Social network",,,"Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet",,,,,22217932,,,"Russian","Komp'ut.

Using original data on the backgrounds of Russian mayors between 2000 and 2012, we examine how the biographies of elected and appointed mayors differ. We find that differences between the two types of officials are modest, but noteworthy. On the one hand, elected mayors have more experience holding elected office and are more educated, which could indicate that they are of higher quality. Moreover, elected mayors turn over at a much lower rate, which indicates lower levels of political instability. Yet appointed mayors have more executive governing experience and are less likely to come from business backgrounds, which may indicate that elections provide more opportunities for business capture.

A single slot is a time span that can be assigned to a task, which is a part of a job. The job launch requires a co-allocation of a specified number of slots starting synchronously. The challenge is that slots associated with different resources of distributed computational environments may have arbitrary start and finish points that do not match. Some existing algorithms assign a job to the first set of slots matching the resource request without any optimization (the first fit type), while other algorithms are based on an exhaustive search. In this paper, algorithms for effective slot selection of linear complexity on an available slots number are studied and compared with known approaches. The novelty of the proposed approach consists of allocating alternative sets of slots. It provides possibilities to optimize job scheduling. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Batch; Distributed computing; Economic scheduling; Job; Resource management; Slot; Task","Distributed computer systems; Parallel architectures; Scheduling; Batch; Economic scheduling; Job; Resource management; Slot; Task; Algorithms",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",,,,,09208542,,JOSUE,"English","J Supercomput",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905573764

PSA is involved in cell signaling and intermolecular interactions with proteins and peptides. The antimicrobial potential of peptides is usually evaluated in model membranes consisting of lipid bilayers but devoid of either PSA or its analogs. The goal of this work was to investigate the possible effect of PSA on the structure of melittin (Mlt) and latarcins Ltc1K, Ltc2a, and the activity of these peptides with respect to model membranes. These peptides are linear cationic ones derived from the venom of bee (Mlt) and spider (both latarcins). The length of each of the peptides is 26 amino acid residues, and they all have antimicrobial activity. However, they differ with respect to conformational mobility, hydrophobic characteristics, and overall charge. In this work, using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that the peptides adopt an α-helical conformation upon interaction with either PSA or phospholipid liposomes formed of either zwitterionic or anionic phospholipids or their mixtures. The extent of helicity depends on the amino acid sequence and properties of the medium. Based on small angle X-ray scattering data and the analysis of the fluorescence spectrum of the Trp residue in Mlt, we conclude that the peptide forms an oligomeric complex consisting of α-helical Mlt and several PSA molecules. Both latarcins, unlike Mlt, the most hydrophobic of the peptides, interact weakly with zwitterionic liposomes. However, they bind anionic liposomes or those composed of anionic/zwitterionic lipid mixtures. Latarcin Ltc1K forms associates on liposomes composed of zwitterionic/anionic lipid mixture. The structure of the peptide associates is either disordered or of β-sheet conformation. In all other cases the studied peptides adopt predominately α-helical conformation. In addition, we demonstrate that PSA inhibits membranolytic activity of Mlt and latarcin Ltc1K. These data suggest that the peptides, due to their high conformational lability, can vary structural and amphiphilic properties in the presence of PSA. As a result, various scenarios of the interaction of the peptides with membranes, whose surface is abundant with anionic polysaccharides, can take place. This can account for difficulties in understanding the structure-functional relationships in interactions of linear cationic peptides with biological membranes. © 2014 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","circular dichroism; cytolytic peptides; latarcins; linear cationic peptides; melittin; phospholipid liposomes; sialic acid","antimicrobial cationic peptide; cation; latarcin 2a, Lachesana tarabaevi; lipid bilayer; liposome; Ltc1 peptide, Lachesana tarabaevi; melittin; peptide; phospholipid; polysialic acid; protein binding; sialic acid derivative; spider venom; amino acid sequence; chemical phenomena; chemistry; circular dichroism; lipid bilayer; metabolism; molecular genetics; protein secondary structure; Amino Acid Sequence; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Cations; Circular Dichroism; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Lipid Bilayers; Liposomes; Melitten; Molecular Sequence Data; Peptides; Phospholipids; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Secondary; Sialic Acids; Spider Venoms",,"Maik Nauka Publishing / Springer SBM",,,,,00062979,,BIORA,"English","Biochemistry Moscow",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901021336

With the assumption of deteriorating jobs, the job processing times are described by an increasing function of their starting times. All the jobs are first partitioned into serial batches and then processed on a single serial-batching machine. Before each batch is processed, an independent constant setup time is required. Two optimization algorithms are proposed to solve the problems of minimizing the makespan and the total number of tardy jobs, respectively. Specifically, for the problem of minimizing the total completion time, two special cases with the smallest and the largest number of batches are studied, and an optimization algorithm is also presented for the special case without setup time. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Deteriorating jobs; Serial-batching scheduling; Setup time; Single machine","Algorithms; Deterioration; Optimization; Problem solving; Scheduling; Deteriorating jobs; Increasing functions; Job processing time; Number of tardy jobs; Optimization algorithms; Set-up time; Single- machines; Total completion time; Scheduling algorithms",,"Springer Verlag",,,,,18624472,,,"English","Optim.

The participant’s average correct response rate was 85.1%; they made errors in 9.6% trials and response omissions in 5.4% trials. Peak N1 of the evoked potential was consistent across all behavioral outcomes, while peak P2 amplitude was significantly greater before errors and response omissions compared to correct responses. The analysis of polygraphic indexes (ECG, CMC, SC1R) did not reveal any arousal level reduction before attentional lapses. The proposed interpretation of the results obtained is based on the assumption that attentional lapses are mediated by the suppression of external stimuli information processing caused by the state of mind-wandering. © 2014, Maik Nauka-Interperiodica Publishing.

Examples of plasma parameters at which the pressure-fluctuation distribution function is not normal but can be approximated by the sum of two normal distributions were found. The electron-ion interaction is described by the Coulomb potential cut-off at the depth of the potential well that is independent of the temperature and the particle density. The requirements on the choice of the interaction potential parameters and the number of particles in a calculation cell are discussed. The free and bound states are not separated in any way, which makes it possible to take into account successively the influence of density effects in the electron state spectrum on the thermodynamic properties. © 2014 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,"Electric fields; Normal distribution; Classical molecular dynamics; Coulomb potential; Electron-ion interactions; Influence of density; Interaction potentials; Particle densities; Plasma parameter; Pressure fluctuation; Molecular dynamics",,"Maik Nauka Publishing / Springer SBM",,,,,0018151X,,HITEA,"English","High Temp.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906244106

It is suggested that correlation coefficients between, on one hand, the distribution of qualitative codes and, on the other hand, word co-occurrences and the distribution of the categories identified with the help of the dictionary based on substitution complement the other reliability measures. The paper shows that the choice of the reliability measure depends on the format of the text (stylistic versus rhetorical) and the type of reading (comprehension versus interpretation). Namely, Cohen's kappa and Bennett, Alpert and Goldstein's S emerge as reliability measures particularly suited for perspectival reading of rhetorical texts.

It provides an alternative (to the nested Bethe ansatz) method for computation of spectra of the spin chains. Namely, the spectrum of the quantum transfer matrix for the inhomogeneous gl n -invariant XXX spin chain on N sites with twisted boundary conditions can be found in terms of velocities of particles in the rational N -body Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. The possible values of the velocities are to be found from intersection points of two Lagrangian submanifolds in the phase space of the classical model. One of them is the Lagrangian hyperplane corresponding to fixed coordinates of all N particles and the other one is an N -dimensional Lagrangian submanifold obtained by fixing levels of N classical Hamiltonians in involution. The latter are determined by eigenvalues of the twist matrix. To support this picture, we give a direct proof that the eigenvalues of the Lax matrix for the classical Ruijsenaars-Schneider model, where velocities of particles are substituted by eigenvalues of the spin chain Hamiltonians, calculated through the Bethe equations, coincide with eigenvalues of the twist matrix, with certain multiplicities. We also prove a similar statement for the gl n Gaudin model with N marked points (on the quantum side) and the Calogero-Moser system with N particles (on the classical side). The realization of the results obtained in terms of branes and supersymmetric gauge theories is also discussed. © 2014 The Author(s).","Bethe Ansatz; Duality in Gauge Field Theories; Integrable Hierarchies",,,,,,,,11266708,,,"English","J.

While it has been theoretically proven that network coding saves bandwidth and increases throughput of multicast communication, it does not directly consider the quality of service (QoS) requirements of multicast routing. In this paper, we study the problem of establishing minimum-cost, multiple multicast sessions over coded packet networks to meet the statistical QoS target considering bounded end-to-end statistical delay and jitter from source to each destination. For this purpose, we first propose a path-based formulation for the problem and prove that this problem is NP-hard. Then, in order to obtain an exact solution, we present an effective and efficient decomposition approach in which the problem is decomposed into master problem and subproblems, and the solution is built up successively by feasible path generation. Computational results on random networks show that the proposed method provides an efficient way for solving the problem, even for relatively large networks. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Communication networks; Keywords; Multicast; Network coding; Quality of service","Jitter; Multicasting; Network coding; Network routing; Packet networks; Quality of service; Telecommunication networks; Telecommunication systems; Computational results; Efficient decomposition; Keywords; Multicast communication; Multicast routing; Multicast sessions; Qualityof-service requirement (QoS); Statistical delays; Problem solving",,"Academic Press",,,,,10848045,,,"English","J Network Comput Appl",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899102085

The search structure is based on a navigable small world graph with vertices corresponding to the stored elements, edges to links between them, and a variation of greedy algorithm for searching. The navigable small world is created simply by keeping old Delaunay graph approximation links produced at the start of construction. The approach is very universal, defined in terms of arbitrary metric spaces and at the same time it is very simple. The algorithm handles insertions in the same way as queries: by finding approximate neighbors for the inserted element and connecting it to them. Both search and insertion can be done in parallel requiring only local information from the structure. The structure can be made distributed. The accuracy of the probabilistic k-nearest neighbor queries can be adjusted without rebuilding the structure. The performed simulation for data in the Euclidean spaces shows that the structure built using the proposed algorithm has small world navigation properties with log2(n) insertion and search complexity at fixed accuracy, and performs well at high dimensionality. Simulation on a CoPHiR dataset revealed its high efficiency in case of large datasets (more than an order of magnitude less metric computations at fixed recall) compared to permutation indexes. Only 0.03% of the 10 million 208-dimensional vector dataset is needed to be evaluated to achieve 0.999 recall (virtually exact search). For recall 0.93 processing speed 2800 queries/s can be achieved on a dual Intel X5675 Xenon server node with Java implementation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Approximate nearest neighbor; Distributed data structure; k-Nearest neighbor; Navigable small world; Similarity search","Automatic indexing; Set theory; Topology; Approximate nearest neighbor; Distributed data structures; K-nearest neighbors; Similarity search; Small worlds; Algorithms",,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,03064379,,INSYD,"English","Inf.

Recordings of magnetic activity throughout whole experimental sessions in all subjects were concatenated into a single sequence, which was separated into independent components using independent component analysis and ranked according to the amount of mutual information with the modified accelerometer signal. Independent components that demonstrated maximum relation to the linger movement were averaged relative to the movement onset. The results of the distributed brain source modeling of the two independent components that manifested maximum amount of mutual information has demonstrated that their sources localize in the cortical areas corresponding to anatomical markers of hand representation in the primary motor and the primary sensory cortices contralateral to the movement.

The research exploits the enormous wildfires that occurred in rural Russia during the summer of 2010 as a natural experiment. The authors test the effects of fires with a survey of almost eight hundred respondents in seventy randomly selected villages. The study finds that in the burned villages there is higher support for the government at all levels. Most counterintuitively, the rise of support for authorities cannot be fully explained by the generous governmental aid. The authors interpret the results by the demonstration effect of the government's performance.

Previous data on the effects of these factors are equivocal, possibly due to language- and task-specific factors.Aims: The present study aimed to investigate the nature of the instrumentality and verb-noun name relation effects by retesting them in a large sample of Russian-speaking individuals with fluent and non-fluent aphasia.Methods & Procedures: Forty Russian-speaking individuals with aphasia (twenty with fluent and twenty with non-fluent aphasia) and twenty controls performed an action naming task. Overall accuracy scores and qualitative error types were analysed.Outcomes & Results: A positive effect of instrumentality was found in both groups of individuals with aphasia. A negative effect of verb-noun name relation was found in non-fluent aphasia and was larger for verbs with a smaller overlap with the instrument noun. In both aphasia groups, semantically related errors were more numerous for non-instrumental than instrumental verbs, whereas phonological errors were more numerous for name-related than non-name-related instrumental verbs.Conclusions: The positive effect of instrumentality on verb retrieval may be attributed to a facilitatory effect of richer conceptual representations of instrumental verbs. The negative effect of name relation on verb retrieval may be explained by interference of the phonological form of the instrument noun. These factors influence verb retrieval in aphasia and should be taken into account when developing testing/treatment materials and stimuli for experimental studies. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Aphasia; Instrumentality; Russian; Verb-finding difficulties; Verb-noun name relation",,,"Routledge",,,,,02687038,,APHAE,"English","Aphasiology",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905734278

Because of the excellent characteristics and the possibility to be effectively coupled to singlemode optical fiber many applications of the SSPD have already been reported. The most impressive one is the quantum key distribution (QKD) over 250 km distance. This demonstration shows further possibilities for the improvement of the characteristics of quantum-cryptographic systems such as increasing the bit rate and the quantum channel length, and decreasing the quantum bit error rate (QBER). This improvement is possible because SSPDs have the best characteristics in comparison with other single-photon detectors. We have demonstrated the possibility of polarization state reconstruction and measurement over 302.5 km with superconducting single-photon detectors. The advantage of an autocompensating optical scheme, also known as ""plug&play"" for quantum key distribution, is high stability in the presence of distortions along the line. To increase the distance of quantum key distribution with this optical scheme we implement the superconducting single photon detectors (SSPD). At the 5 MHz pulse repetition frequency and the average photon number equal to 0.4 we measured a 33 bit/s quantum key generation for a 101.7 km single mode ber quantum channel. The extremely low SSPD dark count rate allowed us to keep QBER at 1.6% level. © 2014 SPIE.","Quantum communication; Quantum cryptography; Quantum key distribution; Superconducting Single-Photon Detectors","Avalanche photodiodes; Bit error rate; Communication channels (information theory); Cryptography; Nanoelectronics; Optical communication; Optical fibers; Particle beams; Photodetectors; Photons; Polarization; Quantum communication; Quantum entanglement; Cryptographic systems; Polarization state; Pulse repetition frequencies; Quantum bit error rate; Quantum key-generation; Single-mode optical fiber; Single-photon detectors; Superconducting single-photon detectors; Quantum cryptography","et al.;Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations;NIX Company;Russian Academy of Sciences;Russian Foundation for Basic Researches;TechnoInfo Ltd.","SPIE","International Conference on Micro- and Nano-Electronics 2014, ICMNE 2014","6 October 2014 through 10 October 2014",,110816,0277786X,9781628415551,PSISD,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923113801

We introduce two statistically optimal algorithms (adaptive maximal likelihood algorithm and statistically optimal phase algorithm) and show that the traditional semblance-based microseismic processing algorithm (Seismic Emission Tomography) is just an extreme case of the maximal likelihood algorithm for Gaussian white noise (i.e., noise that is stationary and uncorrelated in time and space). We evaluate location uncertainties of all three microseismic algorithms for different types of noise patterns and signal-to-noise ratios. For Gaussian white noise, the Seismic Emission Tomography algorithm performs well, demonstrating even slightly better location accuracy than statistically optimal techniques. Actual noise affecting seismic sensors during hydraulic fracturing is non-stationary. It is correlated in time and space, and varies greatly in power and spectral content for different sensors of the array. We use Monte Carlo simulation to show that the location accuracy of statistically optimal algorithms can be 20 to 40 times better than for the Seismic Emission Tomography algorithm in the presence of man-made surface noise during hydraulic fracturing. © 2014 European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers.","Accuracy; Correlated noise; Microseismic; Passive surface; Statistical","Algorithms; Gaussian noise (electronic); Hydraulic fracturing; Monte Carlo methods; Sensors; Surface properties; Tomography; White noise; Accuracy; Correlated noise; Microseismic; Passive surfaces; Statistical; Seismology; accuracy assessment; algorithm; Gaussian method; hydraulic fracture; maximum likelihood analysis; microearthquake; monitoring system; Monte Carlo analysis; seismic source; seismic tomography; signal-to-noise ratio",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",,,,,00168025,,GPPRA,"English","Geophys.

Muthén and Asparouhov recently proposed a new approach to test for approximate rather than exact measurement invariance using Bayesian MGCFA. Approximate measurement invariance permits small differences between parameters otherwise constrained to be equal in the classical exact approach. However, extant knowledge about how results of approximate measurement invariance tests compare to the results of the exact measurement invariance test is missing. We address this gap by comparing the results of exact and approximate cross-country measurement invariance tests of a revised scale to measure human values. Several studies that measured basic human values with the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ) reported problems of measurement noninvariance (especially scalar noninvariance) across countries. Recently Schwartz et al. proposed a refined value theory and an instrument (PVQ-5X) to measure 19 more narrowly defined values. Cieciuch et al. tested its measurement invariance properties across eight countries and established exact scalar measurement invariance for 10 of the 19 values. The current study applied the approximate measurement invariance procedure on the same data and established approximate scalar measurement invariance even for all 19 values. Thus, the first conclusion is that the approximate approach provides more encouraging results for the usefulness of the scale for cross-cultural research, although this finding needs to be generalized and validated in future research using population data. The second conclusion is that the approximate measurement invariance is more likely than the exact approach to establish measurement invariance, although further simulation studies are needed to determine more precise recommendations about how large the permissible variance of the priors may be. © 2014.","Approximate measurement invariance; Bayesian analysis; Configural metric scalar measurement invariance; Exact measurement invariance; Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis; Revised Portrait Values Questionnaire",,,"Frontiers Research Foundation",,,,,16641078,,,"English","Front.

The unusual structure and dynamics of fractal globules are described in this paper.

However, meaningful comparisons of means or relationships between constructs within and across nations require equivalent measurements of these constructs. This is especially true for subjective attributes such as values, attitudes, opinions, or behavior. In this review, we first discuss the concept of cross-group measurement equivalence, look at possible sources of nonequivalence, and suggest ways to prevent it. Next, we examine the social science methodological literature for ways to empirically test for measurement equivalence. Finally, we consider what may be done when equivalence is not supported by the data and conclude with a review of recent developments that offer exciting directions and solutions for future research in cross-national measurement equivalence assessment. © Copyright ©2014 by Annual Reviews.

This analysis reviews national efforts to achieve UHC. With a broad range of health indicators, life expectancy (ranging from 53 years to 73 years), and mortality rate in children younger than 5 years (ranging from 10·3 to 44·6 deaths per 1000 livebirths), a review of progress in each of the BRICS countries shows that each has some way to go before achieving UHC. The BRICS countries show substantial, and often similar, challenges in moving towards UHC. On the basis of a review of each country, the most pressing problems are: raising insufficient public spending; stewarding mixed private and public health systems; ensuring equity; meeting the demands for more human resources; managing changing demographics and disease burdens; and addressing the social determinants of health. Increases in public funding can be used to show how BRICS health ministries could accelerate progress to achieve UHC. Although all the BRICS countries have devoted increased resources to health, the biggest increase has been in China, which was probably facilitated by China's rapid economic growth. However, the BRICS country with the second highest economic growth, India, has had the least improvement in public funding for health. Future research to understand such different levels of prioritisation of the health sector in these countries could be useful. Similarly, the role of strategic purchasing in working with powerful private sectors, the effect of federal structures, and the implications of investment in primary health care as a foundation for UHC could be explored. These issues could serve as the basis on which BRICS countries focus their efforts to share ideas and strategies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Article; Brazil; childhood mortality; China; demography; economic development; funding; health care cost; health care policy; health care system; health insurance; human; India; life expectancy; primary health care; public health; Russian Federation; social determinants of health; South Africa; total quality management; universal health coverage; economics; health care delivery; health care financing; health care policy; insurance; organization and management; statistics and numerical data; Brazil; China; Delivery of Health Care; Health Care Reform; Healthcare Financing; Humans; India; Russia; South Africa; Universal Coverage",,"Lancet Publishing Group",,,,,01406736,,LANCA,"English","Lancet",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84917673107

The paper shows that the choice of the reliability measure depends on the format of the text (stylistic versus rhetorical) and the type of reading (comprehension versus interpretation). Namely, Cohen's kappa and Bennett, Alpert and Goldstein's S emerge as reliability measures particularly suited for perspectival reading of rhetorical texts.

It is distinguished by belonging to a particular family of Hurwitz τ-functions, possessing conventional Toda/KP integrability properties. We explain how the variety of recent observations about this function fits into the general theory of matrix model τ-functions. All such quantities possess a number of different descriptions, related in a standard way: these include Toda/KP integrability, several kinds of W-representations (we describe four), two kinds of integral (multi-matrix model) descriptions (of Hermitian and Kontsevich types), Virasoro constraints, character expansion, embedding into generic set of Hurwitz τ-functions and relation to knot theory. When approached in this way, the family of models in the literature has a natural extension, and additional integrability with respect to associated new time-variables. Another member of this extended family is the Itsykson-Zuber integral. © 2014, The Author(s).","Integrable Hierarchies; Matrix Models; Topological Field Theories","Field theory; General theory; Integrability; Integrable hierarchy; Isomorphism class; Matrix model; Natural extension; Virasoro constraints",,"Springer New York LLC",,,,,19317573,,,"English","Nanoscale Res.

The objective is to determine the amount invested into each project such that the overall budget is not exceeded and the total profit is maximized. For this problem, a graphical algorithm (GrA) is presented which is based on the same Bellman equations as the best known dynamic programming algorithm (DPA) but the GrA has several advantages in comparison with the DPA. Based on this GrA, a fully-polynomial time approximation scheme is proposed having the best known running time.

A bicluster reflects a strong association between a subset of objects and a subset of attributes in a numerical object/attribute data-table. So-called biclusters of similar values can be thought as maximal sub-tables with close values. Only few methods address a complete, correct and non-redundant enumeration of such patterns, a well-known intractable problem, while no formal framework exists. We introduce important links between biclustering and Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). Indeed, FCA is known to be, among others, a methodology for biclustering binary data. Handling numerical data is not direct, and we argue that Triadic Concept Analysis (TCA), the extension of FCA to ternary relations, provides a powerful mathematical and algorithmic framework for biclustering numerical data. We discuss hence both theoretical and computational aspects on biclustering numerical data with triadic concept analysis. These results also scale to n-dimensional numerical datasets. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Formal concept analysis; N-ary relations; Numerical biclustering; Similarity relation; Triadic concept analysis",,,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",,,,,10122443,,,"English","Ann.

The electronic structure of graphene is described using the Shubin-Vonsovsky model taking into account the intratomic, interatomic, and interlayer (in the case of bilayer graphene) Coulomb interactions between electrons. The Cooper instability is determined by solving the Bethe-Saltpeter integral equation. The renormalized scattering amplitude is obtained with allowance for the Kohn-Luttinger polarization contributions up to the second order of perturbation theory in the Coulomb interaction. It plays the role of effective interaction in the Bethe-Salpeter integral equation. It is shown that the allowance for the Kohn-Luttinger renormalizations as well as intersite Coulomb interaction noticeably affects the competition between the superconducting phases with the f-wave and d + id-wave symmetries of the order parameter.

The possibility of a strong increase in the superconducting transition temperature T c even for a low electron density is demonstrated by analyzing the spin-polarized case or the two-band situation. The Kohn-Luttinger theory explains or predicts superconductivity in various materials such as heterostructures and semimetals, superlattices and dichalcogenides, high-T c superconductors and heavy-fermion systems, layered organic superconductors, and ultracold Fermi gases in magnetic traps. This theory also describes the anomalous electron transport and peculiar polaron effects in the normal state of these systems.

The agents' conjectures concern the price variations depending upon their production output increase or decrease. We establish the existence and uniqueness results for the CVE (called exterior equilibrium) for any set of feasible conjectures. To introduce the notion of interior equilibrium, we develop a consistency criterion for the conjectures (referred to as influence coefficients) and prove the existence theorem for the interior equilibrium (understood as CVE with consistent conjectures, or CCVE). In addition, we also examine the behavior of the consistent conjectures as functions of a parameter representing the demand's derivative with respect to the market price. The latter results allow one to predict the behavior of groups of consumers with different consumption abilities. The proposed techniques permit one to develop a qualitative description of the dependence of the market price on the active demand component, too. It should be noticed that due to the non-smoothness of the demand function, there is possibly a path dependency and indeterminacy of equilibria in certain cases. This is, on the one hand, a theoretically inconvenient result (multiple equilibria), but on the other hand, it may happen to be extremely useful for applications. Indeed, the latter multiplicity of equilibria might serve as a rationale for the regulatory intervention to induce a change of equilibrium whenever the total welfare could be improved (cf., for example, the Keynesian stimulus). © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Active demand; Conjectural variations equilibrium; Consistent conjectures; Game theory; Non-continuous demand function",,,"Springer Netherlands",,,,,02545330,,,"English","Ann.

However, there are few data on such possible interactions. Methods: We analyzed day-to-day variations in the number of deaths in Moscow, Russia, in relation to air pollution levels and temperature during the disastrous heat wave and wildfire of 2010. Corresponding data for the period 2006-2009 were used for comparison. Daily average levels of PM10 and ozone were obtained from several continuous measurement stations. The daily number of nonaccidental deaths from specific causes was extracted from official records. Analyses of interactions considered the main effect of temperature as well as the added effect of prolonged high temperatures and the interaction with PM10. Results: The major heat wave lasted for 44 days, with 24-hour average temperatures ranging from 24°C to 31°C and PM10 levels exceeding 300 μg/m on several days. There were close to 11,000 excess deaths from nonaccidental causes during this period, mainly among those older than 65 years. Increased risks also occurred in younger age groups. The most pronounced effects were for deaths from cardiovascular, respiratory, genitourinary, and nervous system diseases. Continuously increasing risks following prolonged high temperatures were apparent during the first 2 weeks of the heat wave. Interactions between high temperatures and air pollution from wildfires in excess of an additive effect contributed to more than 2000 deaths. ConclusionS: Interactions between high temperatures and wildfire air pollution should be considered in risk assessments regarding health consequences of climate change.

However, not all syntactic processes are equally problematic: present time reference, who questions, and reflexives can be processed by narrow syntax alone and are relatively spared compared to past time reference, which questions, and personal pronouns, respectively. The latter need additional access to discourse and information structures to link to their referent outside the clause (Avrutin, 2006). Linguistic processing that requires discourse-linking is difficult for agrammatic individuals: verb morphology with reference to the past is more difficult than with reference to the present (Bastiaanse et al., 2011). The same holds for which questions compared to who questions and for pronouns compared to reflexives (Avrutin, 2006). These results have been reported independently for different populations in different languages. The current study, for the first time, tested all conditions within the same population. Aims: We had two aims with the current study. First, we wanted to investigate whether discourse-linking is the common denominator of the deficits in time reference, wh questions, and object pronouns. Second, we aimed to compare the comprehension of discourse-linked elements in people with agrammatic and fluent aphasia. Methods and procedures: Three sentence-picture-matching tasks were administered to 10 agrammatic, 10 fluent aphasic, and 10 non-brain-damaged Russian speakers (NBDs): (1) the Test for Assessing Reference of Time (TART) for present imperfective (reference to present) and past perfective (reference to past), (2) the Wh Extraction Assessment Tool (WHEAT) for which and who subject questions, and (3) the Reflexive-Pronoun Test (RePro) for reflexive and pronominal reference. Outcomes and results: NBDs scored at ceiling and significantly higher than the aphasic participants. We found an overall effect of discourse-linking in the TART and WHEAT for the agrammatic speakers, and in all three tests for the fluent speakers. Scores on the RePro were at ceiling. Conclusions: The results are in line with the prediction that problems that individuals with agrammatic and fluent aphasia experience when comprehending sentences that contain verbs with past time reference, which question words and pronouns are caused by the fact that these elements involve discourse linking. The effect is not specific to agrammatism, although it may result from different underlying disorders in agrammatic and fluent aphasia. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Aphasia; Discourse-linking; Pronouns; Sentence comprehension; Tense; Time reference; Wh Questions","adult; aged; agrammatic aphasia; aphasia; article; clinical article; comprehension; controlled study; discourse analysis; female; fluent aphasia; human; language processing; male; middle aged; Russian Federation; aphasia; neuropsychological test; pathophysiology; physiology; psychology; reference value; semantics; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aphasia; Comprehension; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Reference Values; Russia; Semantics; Young Adult",,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,00283932,,NUPSA,"English","Neuropsychologia",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896656870

Besides acting as the network, intercepting, decomposing, composing and sending messages, he can remember as much information as he needs. That is, his memory is unbounded. We recently proposed a weaker Dolev-Yao like adversary, which also acts as the network, but whose memory is bounded. We showed that this Bounded Memory Dolev-Yao adversary, when given enough memory, can carry out many existing protocol anomalies. In particular, the known anomalies arise for bounded memory protocols, where although the total number of sessions is unbounded, there are only a bounded number of concurrent sessions and the honest participants of the protocol cannot remember an unbounded number of facts or an unbounded number of nonces at a time. This led us to the question of whether it is possible to infer an upper-bound on the memory required by the Dolev-Yao adversary to carry out an anomaly from the memory restrictions of the bounded protocol.

We include first order α′ corrections to the heterotic supergravity action, which imply a non-trivial Yang-Mills sector and Bianchi identity. We present a variety of solutions, depending on the choice of instantons, for the special case in which the SU(3) structure on X<inf>6</inf> satisfies (Formula presented.). The solutions preserve two real supercharges, which corresponds to (Formula presented.) supersymmetry from the four-dimensional point of view. Besides serving as a useful framework for collecting existing solutions, the formulation in terms of dynamic SU(3) structures utilized here allows us to obtain new solutions in as yet unexplored corners of the instanton configuration space. Our approach thus offers a unified description of the embedding of tanh-kink-type instantons into half-BPS solutions of heterotic supergravity where the internal six-dimensional manifold has a warped nearly Kähler geometry. © 2014, The Author(s).","Flux compactifications; Solitons Monopoles and Instantons; Supergravity Models",,,"Springer Verlag",,,,,11266708,,,"English","J.

The fracking-induced fractures in the rock, which are hydrodynamically connected with the wells, significantly enhance the volumes of extracted hydrocarbons. Controlling the processes of fracture formation and propagation is a vital question in the oil and gas reservoir management. A key means to implement this control is provided by microseismic monitoring of fracking, which makes it possible to promptly reconstruct the geometry of the fractures from the data on seismic waves from the microearthquakes induced by the formation and propagation of fractures. © 2014 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,,"Maik Nauka-Interperiodica Publishing",,,,,10693513,,,"English","Izv.

They rely on the electromagnetic field associated with photons to carry information from one point to another in space. A complete physical model of these channels must necessarily take quantum effects into account to determine their ultimate performances. Single-mode, phase-insensitive bosonic Gaussian channels have been extensively studied over past decades, given their importance for practical applications. In spite of this, a long-standing unsolved conjecture on the optimality of Gaussian encodings has prevented finding their classical communication capacity. Here, this conjecture is solved by proving that the vacuum state achieves the minimum output entropy of these channels. This establishes the ultimate achievable bit rate under an energy constraint, as well as the long awaited proof that the single-letter classical capacity of these channels is additive. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A similar result, Theorem 1.1, is also established for unitarily invariant measures on the space of all infinite complex matrices. These results imply that the infinite Hua-Pickrell measures of Borodin and Olshanski have finite ergodic components. The proof is based on the approach of Olshanski and Vershik. First, it is shown that if the sequence of orbital measures assigned to almost every point is weakly precompact, then our ergodic measure must indeed be finite. The second step, which completes the proof, shows that if a unitarily-invariant measure admits well-defined projections onto the quotient space of finite corners, then for almost every point the corresponding sequence of orbital measures is indeed weakly precompact.","Classification of ergodic measures; Hua-Pickrell measures; Infinite-dimensional Lie groups; Orbital measures; Weak compactness",,,"Association des Annales de l'Institut Fourier",,,,,03730956,,,"English","Ann.

We prove that the secrecy problem is PSPACE-complete in the bounded memory model where all actions are balanced and a potentially infinite number of the nonce updates is allowed. We also show that the well-known security protocol anomalies (starting from the Lowe attack to the Needham-Schroeder protocol) can be rephrased within the bounded memory paradigm with the explicit memory bounds. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The heroic, expedition-based style of Arctic science, dominant in the first decades of the twentieth century, gave way to a systematic, long-term, strategic and largely statefunded model of research which increased both Arctic presence and the volume of research output. Factors that made this change possible were distinct for each of the five circumpolar nation-states considered here. For Soviet leaders, the Arctic was an untamed land containing vast economic resources, all within reach if its long-sought Northern Sea Route became reality; Soviet officials sought environmental knowledge of this region with a range of motivations from economic and strategic concerns to enhancing the prestige of socialism. In contrast, United States officials largely ignored the Arctic until the outbreak of World War II, when military commanders quickly grasped the strategic importance of this region. Anxious that the Arctic might become a literal battleground between East and West by 1947, as the Cold War began, Pentagon leaders funded vast northern research programs, including in strategically located Greenland. Canadian leaders-while appreciating the national security concerns of its powerful southern neighbor-were even more concerned with maintaining sovereignty over its northern territories and gaining knowledge to assist its northern economic ambitions. Norway and Sweden, as smaller states, faced distinct challenges. With strong claims to Arctic heritage but limited resources, leaders of these states sought to create independent research strategies while, especially in the case of Norway, protecting their geopolitical interests in relation to the Soviet Union and the U.S. This article provides the first internationally comparative study of the multiple economic, military, political, and strategic factors that motivated scientific activities and programs in the far north, from the interwar period through World War II and the Cold War, when carefully coordinated, station-based research programs were introduced. The production of knowledge about Arctic's physical environment-including its changing climate-had little resemblance either to ideas of science-based 'progress,' or responses to perceived environmental concerns. Instead, it demonstrates that strategic military, economic, geopolitical, and national security concerns influenced and shaped most science undertakings, including those of the International Polar Year of 1932-1933 and the following polar year, the International Geophysical Year of 1957-1958. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Arctic; Canada; Cold War; Environment; IGY; IPY; Norway; Polar; Science; Soviet Union; Sweden; United States",,,"Academic Press",,,,,03057488,,,"English","J.

This family models the Josephson effect in superconductivity. We study its rotation number as a function of the parameters and the Arnold tongues (also known as the phase locking domains) defined as the level sets of the rotation number that have nonempty interior. The Arnold tongues of this family of equations have a number of nontypical properties: they exist only for integer values of the rotation number, and the boundaries of the tongues are given by analytic curves. (These results were obtained by Buchstaber-Karpov-Tertychnyi and Ilyashenko-Ryzhov-Filimonov.) The tongue width is zero at the points of intersection of the boundary curves, which results in adjacency points. Numerical experiments and theoretical studies carried out by Buchstaber-Karpov-Tertychnyi and Klimenko-Romaskevich show that each Arnold tongue forms an infinite chain of adjacent domains separated by adjacency points and going to infinity in an asymptotically vertical direction. Recent numerical experiments have also shown that for each Arnold tongue all of its adjacency points lie on one and the same vertical line with integer abscissa equal to the corresponding rotation number. In the present paper, we prove this fact for an open set of two-parameter families of equations in question. In the general case, we prove a weaker claim: the abscissa of each adjacency point is an integer, has the same sign as the rotation number, and does not exceed the latter in absolute value. The proof is based on the representation of the differential equations in question as projectivizations of linear differential equations on the Riemann sphere and the classical theory of linear equations with complex time. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Arnold tongue; irregular singularity; Josephson effect in superconductivity; linear ordinary differential equation with complex time; monodromy; ordinary differential equation on the torus; rotation number; Stokes operator",,,"Springer New York LLC",,,,,00162663,,,"English","Funct.

The Affective Attachment and Deference subscales demonstrated full metric invariance whereas the Personal-Life Inclusion subscale was found to have partial metric invariance across all eight samples. Structural equation modeling revealed that the affective attachment dimension had a cross-nationally invariant positive relationship to affective organizational commitment and a negative relationship to turnover intention. The deference to the supervisor dimension had invariant positive relationships with both affective and normative organizational commitment.

Although researchers have compared cohabitation cross-nationally using quantitative data, few have compared union formation using qualitative data. Objective: We use focus group research to compare social norms of cohabitation and marriage in Australia and nine countries in Europe. We explore questions such as: what is the meaning of cohabitation? To what extent is cohabitation indistinguishable from marriage, a prelude to marriage, or an alternative to being single? Are the meanings of cohabitation similar across countries? Methods: Collaborators conducted seven to eight focus groups in each country using a standardized guideline. They analyzed the discussions with bottom-up coding in each thematic area. They then collated the data in a standardized report. The first and second authors systematically analyzed the reports, with direct input from collaborators. Results: The results describe a specific picture of union formation in each country. However, three themes emerge in all focus groups: commitment, testing, and freedom. The pervasiveness of these concepts suggests that marriage and cohabitation have distinct meanings, with marriage representing a stronger level of commitment. Cohabitation is a way to test the relationship, and represents freedom. Nonetheless, other discourses emerged, suggesting that cohabitation has multiple meanings. Conclusions: This study illuminates how context shapes partnership formation, but also presents underlying reasons for the development of cohabitation.

What might be the source of coherence? We view political values as expressions, in the political domain, of more basic personal values. Basic personal values (e.g., security, achievement, benevolence, hedonism) are organized on a circular continuum that reflects their conflicting and compatible motivations. We theorize that this circular motivational structure also gives coherence to political values. We assess this theorizing with data from 15 countries, using eight core political values (e.g., free enterprise, law and order) and ten basic personal values. We specify the underlying basic values expected to promote or oppose each political value. We offer different hypotheses for the 12 non-communist and three post-communist countries studied, where the political context suggests different meanings of a basic or political value. Correlation and regression analyses support almost all hypotheses. Moreover, basic values account for substantially more variance in political values than age, gender, education, and income. Multidimensional scaling analyses demonstrate graphically how the circular motivational continuum of basic personal values structures relations among core political values. This study strengthens the assumption that individual differences in basic personal values play a critical role in political thought. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Basic personal values; Political values; Structure of political thought; Value coherence",,,"Springer New York LLC",,,,,01909320,,,"English","Polit.

Minor cervical traumas, infection, migraine and hypertension are putative risk factors1-3, and inverse associations with obesity and hypercholesterolemia are described3,4. No confirmed genetic susceptibility factors have been identified using candidate gene approaches5. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in 1,393 CeAD cases and 14,416 controls. The rs9349379[G] allele (PHACTR1) was associated with lower CeAD risk (odds ratio (OR) = 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.69-0.82; P = 4.46 × 10-10), with confirmation in independent follow-up samples (659 CeAD cases and 2,648 controls; P = 3.91 × 10-3; combined P = 1.00 × 10-11). The rs9349379[G] allele was previously shown to be associated with lower risk of migraine and increased risk of myocardial infarction6-9.

Unfortunately, improvements in socioeconomic conditions are usually associated with increased cancer incidence. In this Commission, we focus on China, India, and Russia, which share rapidly rising cancer incidence and have cancer mortality rates that are nearly twice as high as in the UK or the USA, vast geographies, growing economies, ageing populations, increasingly westernised lifestyles, relatively disenfranchised subpopulations, serious contamination of the environment, and uncontrolled cancer-causing communicable infections. We describe the overall state of health and cancer control in each country and additional specific issues for consideration: for China, access to care, contamination of the environment, and cancer fatalism and traditional medicine for India, affordability of care, provision of adequate health personnel, and sociocultural barriers to cancer control; and for Russia, monitoring of the burden of cancer, societal attitudes towards cancer prevention, effects of inequitable treatment and access to medicine, and a need for improved international engagement. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"amrubicin; antineoplastic agent; bevacizumab; cyclophosphamide; eribulin; everolimus; herbaceous agent; lapatinib; lenalidomide; melphalan; trastuzumab; Wart virus vaccine; air quality; breast cancer; cancer control; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer palliative therapy; cancer prevention; cancer radiotherapy; cancer research; cancer screening; cancer statistics; childhood leukemia; China; chronic myeloid leukemia; colorectal cancer; cultural factor; drug use; economic development; esophagus cancer; ethnic difference; food contamination; health care access; health care cost; health care delivery; health care disparity; health care personnel; health insurance; human; India; lung cancer; neoplasm; politics; pollution; postgraduate education; priority journal; prostate cancer; reimbursement; review; Russian Federation; sexism; social aspect; social behavior; socioeconomics; stigma; stomach cancer; traditional medicine; urban rural difference; uterine cervix cancer; water pollution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alcoholism; Breast Neoplasms; China; Colorectal Neoplasms; Cultural Characteristics; Early Detection of Cancer; Economic Development; Environmental Pollution; Ethnic Groups; Female; Health Manpower; Health Services; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; India; Male; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Rural Health Services; Russia; Sexism; Smoking; Social Stigma; Urban Health Services",,"Lancet Publishing Group",,,,,14702045,,LOANB,"English","Lancet Oncol.",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898041689

The ZTPI is proven to be a valid and reliable index of individual differences in time perspective across five temporal categories: Past Negative, Past Positive, Present Fatalistic, Present Hedonistic, and Future. We obtained evidence for invariance of 36 items (out of 56) and also the five-factor structure of ZTPI across 23 countries. The short ZTPI scales are reliable for country-level analysis, whereas we recommend the use of the full scales for individual-level analysis. The short version of ZTPI will further promote integration of research in the time perspective domain in relation to many different psycho-social processes. © The Author(s) 2014.","Cross-cultural research; Equivalence; Time perspective; Zimbardo time perspective inventory; ZTPI",,,"SAGE Publications Inc.",,,,,21582440,,,"English","SAGE Open",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901350509

The rise in obesity has led to widespread calls for regular monitoring of changes in overweight and obesity prevalence in all populations. Comparable, up-to-date information about levels and trends is essential to quantify population health effects and to prompt decision makers to prioritise action. We estimate the global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980-2013. Methods We systematically identified surveys, reports, and published studies (n=1769) that included data for height and weight, both through physical measurements and self-reports. We used mixed effects linear regression to correct for bias in self-reports. We obtained data for prevalence of obesity and overweight by age, sex, country, and year (n=19 244) with a spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression model to estimate prevalence with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Findings Worldwide, the proportion of adults with a body-mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or greater increased between 1980 and 2013 from 28·8% (95% UI 28·4-29·3) to 36·9% (36·3-37·4) in men, and from 29·8% (29·3- 30·2) to 38·0% (37·5-38·5) in women. Prevalence has increased substantially in children and adolescents in developed countries; 23·8% (22·9-24·7) of boys and 22·6% (21·7-23·6) of girls were overweight or obese in 2013. The prevalence of overweight and obesity has also increased in children and adolescents in developing countries, from 8·1% (7·7-8·6) to 12·9% (12·3-13·5) in 2013 for boys and from 8·4% (8·1-8·8) to 13·4% (13·0-13·9) in girls. In adults, estimated prevalence of obesity exceeded 50% in men in Tonga and in women in Kuwait, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Libya, Qatar, Tonga, and Samoa. Since 2006, the increase in adult obesity in developed countries has slowed down. Interpretation Because of the established health risks and substantial increases in prevalence, obesity has become a major global health challenge. Not only is obesity increasing, but no national success stories have been reported in the past 33 years. Urgent global action and leadership is needed to help countries to more effectively intervene.

Timely measurements of levels and trends in under-5 mortality are important to assess progress towards the Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG 4) target of reduction of child mortality by two thirds from 1990 to 2015, and to identify models of success. Methods: We generated updated estimates of child mortality in early neonatal (age 0-6 days), late neonatal (7-28 days), postneonatal (29-364 days), childhood (1-4 years), and under-5 (0-4 years) age groups for 188 countries from 1970 to 2013, with more than 29 000 survey, census, vital registration, and sample registration datapoints. We used Gaussian process regression with adjustments for bias and non-sampling error to synthesise the data for under-5 mortality for each country, and a separate model to estimate mortality for more detailed age groups. We used explanatory mixed effects regression models to assess the association between under-5 mortality and income per person, maternal education, HIV child death rates, secular shifts, and other factors. To quantify the contribution of these different factors and birth numbers to the change in numbers of deaths in under-5 age groups from 1990 to 2013, we used Shapley decomposition. We used estimated rates of change between 2000 and 2013 to construct under-5 mortality rate scenarios out to 2030. Findings: We estimated that 6·3 million (95% UI 6·0-6·6) children under-5 died in 2013, a 64% reduction from 17·6 million (17·1-18·1) in 1970. In 2013, child mortality rates ranged from 152·5 per 1000 livebirths (130·6-177·4) in Guinea-Bissau to 2·3 (1·8-2·9) per 1000 in Singapore. The annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2013 ranged from -6·8% to 0·1%. 99 of 188 countries, including 43 of 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, had faster decreases in child mortality during 2000-13 than during 1990-2000. In 2013, neonatal deaths accounted for 41·6% of under-5 deaths compared with 37·4% in 1990. Compared with 1990, in 2013, rising numbers of births, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, led to 1·4 million more child deaths, and rising income per person and maternal education led to 0·9 million and 2·2 million fewer deaths, respectively. Changes in secular trends led to 4·2 million fewer deaths. Unexplained factors accounted for only -1% of the change in child deaths. In 30 developing countries, decreases since 2000 have been faster than predicted attributable to income, education, and secular shift alone. Interpretation: Only 27 developing countries are expected to achieve MDG 4. Decreases since 2000 in under-5 mortality rates are accelerating in many developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The Millennium Declaration and increased development assistance for health might have been a factor in faster decreases in some developing countries. Without further accelerated progress, many countries in west and central Africa will still have high levels of under-5 mortality in 2030.",,"Africa south of the Sahara; age distribution; Article; child; childhood mortality; developing country; educational status; Guinea-Bissau; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; income; infant; infant mortality; live birth; major clinical study; mother; newborn; newborn mortality; priority journal; secularism; Singapore; trend study; article; health; multicenter study; organization; preschool child; risk factor; socioeconomics; statistics; Child Mortality; Child, Preschool; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Organizational Objectives; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; World Health",,"Lancet Publishing Group",,,,,01406736,,LANCA,"English","Lancet",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904972811

The Global Burden of Disease 2013 study provides a consistent and comprehensive approach to disease estimation for between 1990 and 2013, and an opportunity to assess whether accelerated progress has occured since the Millennium Declaration. Methods To estimate incidence and mortality for HIV, we used the UNAIDS Spectrum model appropriately modifi ed based on a systematic review of available studies of mortality with and without antiretroviral therapy (ART). For concentrated epidemics, we calibrated Spectrum models to fi t vital registration data corrected for misclassifi cation of HIV deaths. In generalised epidemics, we minimised a loss function to select epidemic curves most consistent with prevalence data and demographic data for all-cause mortality. We analysed counterfactual scenarios for HIV to assess years of life saved through prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and ART. For tuberculosis, we analysed vital registration and verbal autopsy data to estimate mortality using cause of death ensemble modelling. We analysed data for corrected case-notifi cations, expert opinions on the case-detection rate, prevalence surveys, and estimated cause-specifi c mortality using Bayesian meta-regression to generate consistent trends in all parameters. We analysed malaria mortality and incidence using an updated cause of death database, a systematic analysis of verbal autopsy validation studies for malaria, and recent studies (2010-13) of incidence, drug resistance, and coverage of insecticide-treated bednets. Findings Globally in 2013, there were 1·8 million new HIV infections (95% uncertainty interval 1·7 million to 2·1 million), 29·2 million prevalent HIV cases (28·1 to 31·7), and 1·3 million HIV deaths (1·3 to 1·5). At the peak of the epidemic in 2005, HIV caused 1·7 million deaths (1·6 million to 1·9 million). Concentrated epidemics in Latin America and eastern Europe are substantially smaller than previously estimated. Through interventions including PMTCT and ART, 19·1 million life-years (16·6 million to 21·5 million) have been saved, 70·3% (65·4 to 76·1) in developing countries. From 2000 to 2011, the ratio of development assistance for health for HIV to years of life saved through intervention was US$4498 in developing countries. Including in HIV-positive individuals, all-form tuberculosis incidence was 7·5 million (7·4 million to 7·7 million), prevalence was 11·9 million (11·6 million to 12·2 million), and number of deaths was 1·4 million (1·3 million to 1·5 million) in 2013. In the same year and in only individuals who were HIV-negative, all-form tuberculosis incidence was 7·1 million (6·9 million to 7·3 million), prevalence was 11·2 million (10·8 million to 11·6 million), and number of deaths was 1·3 million (1·2 million to 1·4 million). Annualised rates of change (ARC) for incidence, prevalence, and death became negative after 2000. Tuberculosis in HIV-negative individuals disproportionately occurs in men and boys (versus women and girls); 64·0% of cases (63·6 to 64·3) and 64·7% of deaths (60·8 to 70·3). Globally, malaria cases and deaths grew rapidly from 1990 reaching a peak of 232 million cases (143 million to 387 million) in 2003 and 1·2 million deaths (1·1 million to 1·4 million) in 2004. Since 2004, child deaths from malaria in sub-Saharan Africa have decreased by 31·5% (15·7 to 44·1). Outside of Africa, malaria mortality has been steadily decreasing since 1990. Interpretation Our estimates of the number of people living with HIV are 18·7% smaller than UNAIDS's estimates in 2012. The number of people living with malaria is larger than estimated by WHO. Incidence rates for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria have all decreased since 2000. At the global level, upward trends for malaria and HIV deaths have been reversed and declines in tuberculosis deaths have accelerated. 101 countries (74 of which are developing) still have increasing HIV incidence. Substantial progress since the Millennium Declaration is an encouraging sign of the effect of global action.

These irregularities could indicate a chaotic system and be measured by Lyapunov exponents. We define a functional λ (an ""irregularity index"") that is close to the (maximal) Lyapunov exponent for dynamical systems and well defined for series with a random component: this allows one to work with sunspot numbers. We compute λ for the daily WN from 1850 to 2012 within 4 yr sliding windows: λ exhibit sharp maxima at solar minima and secondary maxima at solar maxima. This pattern is reflected in the ratio R of the amplitudes of the main versus secondary peaks. Two regimes have alternated in the past 150 yr, R1 from 1850 to 1915 (large λ and R values) and R2 from 1935 to 2005 (shrinking difference between main and secondary maxima, R values between 1 and 2). We build an autoregressive model consisting of Poisson noise plus an 11 yr cycle and compute its irregularity index. The transition from R1 to R2 can be reproduced by strengthening the autocorrelation a of the model series. The features of the two regimes are stable for model and WN with respect to embedding dimension and delay. Near the time of the last solar minimum (2008), the irregularity index exhibits a peak similar to the peaks observed before 1915.

In contrast, economic sociology describes competition as a special type of social action that is oriented towards others. More specifically, to remain in the market, competing firms monitor one another and cooperate by establishing inter-organisational social ties. This paper demonstrates that increasing market pressures, including higher levels of competition and stronger bargaining power among exchange partners, does not disrupt social ties but promotes them. Data for the analysis were collected in 2007 from 501 managers of retail chains and their suppliers in five Russia's cities (Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, and Tyumen).

The methodological literature demonstrates that social desirability biases are less prevalent in self-administered surveys, particularly in Web surveys, when there is no interviewer and less risk of presenting oneself in an unfavorable light. Since there is a growing number of users of mobile Web browsers, we focused our study on the effects of different devices (PC or cell phone) in Web surveys on the respondents' willingness to report sensitive information. To reduce selection bias, we carried out a two-wave cross-over experiment using a volunteer online access-panel in Russia. Participants were asked to complete the questionnaire in both survey modes: PC and mobile Web survey. We hypothesized that features of mobile Web usage may affect response accuracy and lead to more socially desirable responses compared to the PC Web survey mode. We found significant differences in the reporting of alcohol consumption by mode, consistent with our hypothesis. But other sensitive questions did not show similar effects. We also found that the presence of familiar bystanders had an impact on the responses, while the presence of strangers did not have any significant effect in either survey mode. Contrary to expectations, we did not find evidence of a positive impact of completing the questionnaire at home and trust in data confidentiality on the level of reporting. These results could help survey practitioners to design and improve data quality in Web surveys completed on different devices. © European Survey Research Association.","Data quality; Interview setting; Mobile web surveys; Perceived privacy; Presence of bystanders; Sensitive questions; Web surveys",,,,,,,,18643361,,,"English","Surv.

In particular in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary and Slovakia the EU-LFS data classify the beneficiaries as inactive. We estimate the number of mothers on parental leave in these countries and show that EU-LFS employment rates of women aged 18-40 are biased downwards 2-7 percentage points; for mothers of children aged 0-2 the bias reaches 12-45 percentage points.

A single slot is a time span that can be assigned to a task, which is a part of a job. The job launch requires a co-allocation of a specified number of slots starting synchronously. The challenge is that slots associated with different resources of distributed computational environments may have arbitrary start and finish points that do not match. Some existing algorithms assign a job to the first set of slots matching the resource request without any optimization (the first fit type), while other algorithms are based on an exhaustive search. In this paper, algorithms for effective slot selection of linear complexity on an available slots number are studied and compared with known approaches. The novelty of the proposed approach consists of allocating alternative sets of slots. It provides possibilities to optimize job scheduling. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","batch; Distributed computing; economic scheduling; job; resource management; slot; task","batch; Economic scheduling; job; Resource management; slot; task; Complex networks; Distributed computer systems; Optimization; Parallel architectures; Scheduling; Clustering algorithms","Russian Academy of Sciences;Russian Fund for Basic Research;Closed Joint Stock Company Intel A/O",,"12th International Conference on Parallel Computing Technologies, PaCT 2013","30 September 2013 through 4 October 2013","St. Petersburg",101370,03029743,9783642399572,,"English","Lect.

Significant periodicities in the range of 22-170 min are found in the variation of the emission intensity, polarisation and the degree of circular polarisation. Periods of the oscillations are not stable: they are different in different sunspots and in the same sunspot on different days. A cross-correlation analysis shows the presence of common significant periods in both NoRH and SSRT data. The cross-correlation coefficients are typically lower than 0.5, which can be attributed to the different heights of the emission formation, and different mechanisms for the emission generation (gyroresonance and thermal bremstrahlung at 17 GHz, and pure gyroresonance at 5.7 GHz).

Ozone and temperature are important atmospheric parameters. The correlation of these parameters is of significant interest from the viewpoint of thermal balance of the middle atmosphere. The basic heating of the stratosphere (altitude range of 20-50 km) is caused by absorption of solar ultraviolet radiation by ozone molecules. Thermal changes influence the rate of ozone formation and destruction. Other types of wave processes can redistribute the structures of vertical profiles of ozone and temperature in the middle atmosphere.

Unsupervised analysis of an imaging MS data set aims at finding hidden structures in the data with no a priori information used and is often exploited as the first step of imaging MS data analysis. We propose a novel, easy-to-use and easy-to-implement approach to answer one of the key questions of unsupervised analysis of imaging MS data: what do all m/z images look like? The key idea of the approach is to cluster all m/z images according to their spatial similarity so that each cluster contains spatially similar m/z images. We propose a visualization of both spatial and spectral information obtained using clustering that provides an easy way to understand what all m/z images look like. We evaluated the proposed approach on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization imaging MS data sets of a rat brain coronal section and human larynx carcinoma and discussed several scenarios of data analysis. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Bioanalytical techniques; Imaging mass spectrometry; Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; Priori information; Spatial localization; Spatial similarity; Spectral information; Unsupervised analysis; Functional polymers; Polymer films; Tissue; Unsupervised learning; Secondary ion mass spectrometry; animal; article; brain; cluster analysis; factual database; histology; human; larynx tumor; mass spectrometry; methodology; pathology; rat; statistics; Animals; Brain; Cluster Analysis; Databases, Factual; Humans; Laryngeal Neoplasms; Mass Spectrometry; Rats; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Statistics as Topic",,,,,,,00032700,,ANCHA,"English","Anal.

This technique is used to improve relevance answering complex questions where an answer is included in multiple sentences. We introduce Parse Thicket as a sum of syntactic parse trees augmented by a number of arcs for inter-sentence word-word relations such as coreference and taxonomic. These arcs are also derived from other sources, including Rhetoric Structure theory, and respective indexing rules are introduced, which identify inter-sentence relations and joins phrases connected by these relations in the search index. Generalization of syntactic parse trees (as a similarity measure between sentences) is defined as a set of maximum common sub-trees for two parse trees. Generalization of a pair of parse thickets to measure relevance of a question and an answer, distributed in multiple sentences, is defined as a set of maximal common sub-parse thickets. The proposed approach is evaluated in the product search domain of eBay.com, where user query includes product names, features and expressions for user needs, and the query keywords occur in different sentences of text. We demonstrate that search relevance is improved by single sentence-level generalization, and further increased by parse thicket generalization.

The algorithm based on the dynamical interaction of synchronized agents which are interdepended genetic algorithms (GAs) having own separate evolutions of their populations. This approach has some similarities with well known ""island model"" of GA. In both methods is used a migration of individuals from agents (""islands"") to the main process (""continent""). In contrast, the intelligent agents in MAGAMO are able to decompose the dimensions space to form evolutions of subpopulations (instead of distribution of initial population as in the standard ""island model""). In the same time, the main (central) process is responsible for the coordination of agents only and their selection according Pareto rules (without evolution). Intelligent agents seek local suboptimal solutions for a global optimization, which will be completed in the result of the interaction of all agents. In the result of this, the amount of needed recalculating the fitnessfunctions can be significantly reduced. It is especially important for the multi-objective optimization related to a large-scale problem.

The material collected in connection with Saltykov's crime is useful for an investigation into magic belief as such, offering parallels and supplementary information to the dozens of ""magic trials"" of the 18th century. However, what makes the Saltykov case unique is how the chancellor's ""superstition"" managed so compellingly to bring together two cultures-traditional folk culture and the ""Europeanized"" culture of the imperial court. The case of Saltykov's ""sorcery"" brought the diametrically opposed cultures of the court elite and the masses into confrontation. But even opposites can come together. As it turned out, the magic beliefs of the masses and medical practices of archaic traditional culture continued to attract adherents at court, getting along just fine in a high-culture, ""Europeanized"" environment. The chasm that lay between the culture of the aristocratic court elite and popular culture in the 18th century was not unbridgeable, although possible intersections of these two cultures sometimes took on rather strange configurations. © 2013 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","homosexuality; popular religiosity; Russian court; Russian Enlightenment; Russian nobility; Ukrainian witchcraft; witchcraft, magic",,,,,,,,0094288X,,,"English","Russ.

Participants searched for an odd-colored target among distractors of one, two, or three other colors. An enduring advantage of large over small sets (i.e., negative slopes of search functions) was found, and this advantage grew with the number of colored subsets among distractors. The results of Experiments 1 and 2 showed that the negative slopes cannot be ascribed to the spatial grouping between distractors but can be partially explained by the spatial density of the visual sets. Hence, it appears that observers relied on numerosity of subsets to guide attention. Experiments 3a and 3b tested the processes within and between color subsets of distractors more precisely. It was found that the visual system collects numerosity statistics that can be used for guidance within each subset independently. However, each subset representation should be serially selected by attention. As attention shifts from one subset to another, the ""statistical power"" effects from every single subset are accumulated to provide a more pronounced negative slope.",,"article; attention; color vision; ensemble representation; feature search; female; human; male; numerosity; pattern recognition; physiology; reaction time; statistical distribution; visual search; attention; ensemble representation; feature search; numerosity; visual search; Attention; Color Perception; Female; Humans; Male; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Reaction Time; Statistical Distributions",,,,,,,15347362,,,"English","J Vis",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898019314

The central aim of this paper is to examine one of the most important concepts in Peirce's theory related to design praxis: the concept of abduction. Abduction is the driving force behind creation and a way of producing new ideas. Peirce's original concept is fundamental in order to maintain constant commitment to innovation required by design. To transmit messages in a creative way it is more effi cient to intensely work with associations by similarity in order to obtain signs rich in information and analogies. Design communicates by all its constituent elements: shape, function, colour, material, technique, technology, etc. Therefore, signs of design share peculiar values of artistic signs as well as those of communicative ones. The associated information is as much aesthetic (shape) as it is semantic (content). The appropriation of Peircean concepts contributes to the understanding of the creative process, which in turn is crucial for understanding new possibilities by means of design.","Abduction; Design innovation; Peircean semiotics; Perception",,,,,,,,14064243,,,"English","Sign.

In this article, I compare the data quality between two survey modes: self-administered web surveys conducted via personal computer and those conducted via mobile phones. Data quality is compared based on five indicators: (a) completion rates, (b) response order effects, (c) social desirability, (d) non-substantive responses, and (e) length of open answers. I hypothesized that mobile web surveys would result in lower completion rates, stronger response order effects, and less elaborate answers to open-ended questions. No difference was expected in the level of reporting in sensitive items and in the rate of non-substantive responses. To test the assumptions, an experiment with two survey modes was conducted using a volunteer online access panel in Russia. As expected, mobile web was associated with a lower completion rate, shorter length of open answers, and similar level of socially undesirable and non-substantive responses. However, no stronger primacy effects in mobile web survey mode were found. © The Author(s) 2013.","completion rates; data quality; length of open-ended questions; mobile web surveys; non-substantive responses; primacy effects; response order effects; social desirability; web surveys",,,,,,,,08944393,,,"English","Soc.

PAIS can generate large data logs that contain information about the interaction of processes in time. Studying PAIS logs with the purpose of data mining and modeling lies within the scope of Process Mining. There is a number of tools developed for Process Mining, including the most ubiquitous ProM, whose functionality is extended by plugins. To perform an object-aware experiment one has to sequentially run multiple plugins. This process becomes extremely time-consuming in the case of large-scale experiments involving a large number of plugins. The paper proposes a concept of DPMine/P language of process modeling and analysis to be implemented in ProM. The language under development aims at joining separate stages of the experiment into a single sequence, that is an experiment model. The implementation of the basic semantics of the language is done through the concept of blocks, ports, connectors and schemes.

Focusing on the post-communist world, and comparing it to more ""developed"" societies, this book reveals the mixed effects of capitalist culture on interpersonal relationships. While most observers blame the egoism and asocial behavior found in new free-market societies on their communist pasts, this work shows how relationships are also threatened by the profit orientations and personal ambition unleashed by economic development. Successful people in societies as diverse as China, Russia, and Eastern Germany adjust to the market economy at a social cost, relaxing their morals in order to obtain success and succumbing to increased material temptations to exploit relationships for their own financial and professional gain. The capitalist personality is internally troubled as a result of this ""sellout,"" but these qualms subside as it devalues intimate qualitative bonds with others. This book also shows that post-communists are similarly individualized as people living in Western societies. Capitalism may indeed favor values of independence, creativity, and self-expressiveness, but it also rewards self-centeredness, consumerism, and the stripping down of morality. As is the case in the West, capitalist culture fosters an internally conflicted and self-centered personality in post-communist societies. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

Next, we take the signals exchanged in those dating profiles and display their intersubjective meanings in Russia based on blogs and discussion fora. Our analysis focuses on gender roles and inter-gender conflicts, the use of economic jargon, the link between luxury consumption and sexuality, and understandings of gift-giving and generosity, in order to show how GFS barters, despite being contractual, carry emotional and romantic content.

We have found significant autocorrelation in the series of durations between sequent crashes and suggest autoregressive conditional duration models (ACD) to forecast the crashes. We apply the rolling intervals technique in the sample of more than 400 DJIA crashes in 1896-2011 and repeatedly use the data on 100 sequent crashes to estimate a family of ACD models and calculate forecasts of the one following crash. It appears that the ACD models provide significant predictive power when combined with the inter-event waiting time technique. This suggests that despite the high quality of retrospective predictions, using the technique for real-time forecasting seems rather ineffective, as in the case of every particular crash the specification of the ACD model, which would provide the best quality prediction, is rather hard to identify. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Being understood in that sense, montage became an international ""grand style"" of the post-WWI epoch. In the Soviet Union this new method had many ideological connotations. It represented history (the historical process as such) as creative and cruel violence. Otherwise, art montage was a method of designing the utopian vision. The following development of montage in Russian culture could be defined as a change of its semantic. It was expelled from the Socialist Realism mainstream (excluding poster graphics), but survived in unofficial art of the 1940s and became postutopian. During the ""Thaw"" period (the late 1950s to the early 1960s) montage methods could indicate the connection of an author with the Soviet or Western European avant-garde of the 1920s. The reconsideration of those methods followed two different ways: imitation of the ""resurrection of revolutionary impulses"" or deconstruction of Soviet historical and social imagination - also with the tools of montage. This very intensive dialogue with the aesthetic tradition of the 1920s came to an end at the beginning of the 1970s. The authors of uncensored art and literature in that period polemicized not with the 1920s, but with the 1960s. The ""living"" translation of the early Soviet montage aesthetics has been settled.","Heterogeneity; Montage poetry; Montage prose; Periodization; Soviet literature",,,,,,,,14064243,,,"Russian","Sign.

The time characteristics of social behavior and its nonverbal manifestation can exert a positive influence on communicative activity and can determine time competence in communication. Ignoring time parameters in the self-realization and self-actualization of personality introduces a certain destructive element into the process of interpersonal relations; hence the necessity of teaching competence in communication arises.

A literature survey shows that the most appropriate techniques for long-term ILI & ARI morbidity projections are the following well-known statistical methods: simple averaging of observations, point-to-point linear estimates, Serfling-type regression models, autoregressive models such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, and generalized exponential smoothing using the Holt-Winters approach. Using these methods and official data on the total number of ILI & ARI cases per week in 2000-2012 in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Yakutsk, we developed one-year projections and evaluated their accuracy. Different methods yielded the best results, depending on the time series. Generally, it is preferable to use the Serfling model. The Serfling model forecasts almost matched the point-to-point linear estimates. In certain cases, ARIMA outperformed the Serfling model. Simple averaging can ensure a fairly good prediction when the ILI & ARI time series do not exhibit a trend.

It begins with examining several theoretical models of international academic collaboration: ""the republic of letters"", ""academic (neo)colonialism"", ""the classical world-system"", and ""the world-society"". Propositions about factors affecting intensity of ties between countries and configuration of their overall network are then derived from each of the models. These propositions are then tested against empirical data on two kinds of academic ties: volumes of international student flows between pairs of countries (UNESCO statistics) and number of co-authored papers (Web of Science database). Negative binomial regression is used to estimate influence of various independent variables (funding of science, distance, historical experience of dependency) about the significance of which the models make different predictions. We discover that expectations associated with ""the classical world-system"" fit the data best, with ""academic neo-colonialist"" factors also important in the case of international student flows. To account for possible differences between disciplines and to capture the directions of evolution of the system, we then explore changes in international collaboration network in two fields: geoscience and economics during a 30-year interval (1980-2010). © AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH Vienna 2013.",,"Historical experience; Independent variables; International academic collaborations; International collaborations; International students; Negative binomial regression; Overall networks; Web of Science; International cooperation; Regression analysis; Education","ASIS and T, USA;Elsevier B.V.;EBSCO Information Services, USA;Federal Ministry for Science and Research, Austria;Federal Ministry for Trans., Innov. and Technol., Austria;et al",,"14th International Society of Scientometrics and Informetrics Conference, ISSI 2013","15 July 2013 through 20 July 2013","Vienna",103046,,9783200031357,,"English","Proc.

The model may apply to the propagation of HF waves in plasmas.

Declare models impose constraints instead of explicitly stating event orders. Constraints can impose various choices and ordering of events; constraints typically have understandable names, but for details, refer to [5]. Current state-of-the-art mining tends to fail due to a computational explosion, and employ filtering to reduce this. Our tool is not intended to provide user-readable models, but instead to provide all constraints satisfied by a model. This allows post-processing to weed out uninteresting constraints, potentially obtaining better resulting models than making filtering beforehand out of necessity. Any post-processing (and complexity-reducing filtering) possible with existing miners is also possible with the UnconstrainedMiner; our miner just allows more intelligent post-processing due to having more information available, such as interactive filtering of models. In our demonstration, we show how the new miner can handle large event logs in short time, and how the resulting output can be imported into Excel for further processing. Our intended audience is researchers interested in Declare mining and users interested in abstract characterization of relationships between events.

Referring to Adam Smith's Impartial Spectator, he argues in favor of the latter and proposes the principle of open impartiality. However, this cannot solve the tension between universalism and contextualization of values that Sen has inherited from Smith. Based on recent Hegel scholarship, we argue that some of the difficulties can be resolved, considering the role Smith played in the development of Hegel's thinking. Hegel's concept of recognition plays an essential role in establishing the possibility of impartiality both on the level of consciousness and on the level of institutional intersubjectivity. Hegel's critique of Kant's formalist ethics (also considered as transcendental institutionalism by Sen) and his analysis of the civil society in the Philosophy of Right, especially his focus on associations and Estates, can serve as a model for making Sen's focus on public discourse theoretically more concise and pragmatically feasible.

Such event data are the starting point for process mining - an emerging scientific discipline relating modeled and observed behavior. The relevance of process mining is increasing as more and more event data become available. The increasing volume of such data ('Big Data') provides both opportunities and challenges for process mining. In this paper we focus on two particular types of process mining: process discovery (learning a process model from example behavior recorded in an event log) and conformance checking (diagnosing and quantifying discrepancies between observed behavior and modeled behavior). These tasks become challenging when there are hundreds or even thousands of different activities and millions of cases. Typically, process mining algorithms are linear in the number of cases and exponential in the number of different activities. This paper proposes a very general divide-and-conquer approach that decomposes the event log based on a partitioning of activities. Unlike existing approaches, this paper does not assume a particular process representation (e.g., Petri nets or BPMN) and allows for various decomposition strategies (e.g., SESE- or passage-based decomposition).

We investigate the links between media, public opinion and foreign policy. In our content analysis of the coverage in two major USnewspapers, we find that the framing of the conflict was anti-Russia, especially in the initial stages of the conflict. In addition, our survey results demonstrate that an increase in the media exposure of US respondents increased the likelihood of blaming Russia exclusively in the conflict. This case study helps us understand how media can be powerful in constructing a certain narrative of an international conflict, which can then affect public perceptions of other countries. We believe that the negative framing of Russia in the US media has had important implications for the already-tenuous relations between the US and Russia by reviving and perpetuating the Cold War mentality for the public as well as for foreign policymakers. © 2013 The Regents of the University of California.","Cold War mentality; Media framing; Public opinion; Russia-Georgia war; US-Russia relations",,,,,,,,0967067X,,,"English","Communist Post-Communist Stud.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888429689

Comparing risk assessments from different sources rapidly becomes non-trivial when more than three credit rating agencies are involved. We propose a method for comparing rating scales, and hence constructing correspondence diagrams and tables, thereby treating the rating scales used by different agencies as objects of study. Scales are compared by looking at sets of ratings assigned to similar entities (hereinafter banks) with the assumption that the risk being measured by each credit rating agency is the same for a given rated entity at a given point in time. Studying international bank ratings for a five-year period shows that there are subtle differences for the largest credit rating agencies. A mechanism for constructing mappings between scales could lead to more competition with new credit rating agencies. © 2013, Eurasia Business and Economics Society.","Comparing; Mapping; Rating; Rating Scale; Regulation",,,"Springer International Publishing",,,,,1309422X,,,"English","Eurasian Econ.

For monodispersed suspension and transport in porous media with distributed pore sizes, the microstochastic model allows for upscaling and the exact solution is derived for the obtained macroscale equation system. Results show that transient pore size distribution and nonlinear relation between the filtration coefficient and captured particle concentration during suspension filtration and retention are the main features of long-term deep bed filtration, which generalises the classical deep bed filtration model and its latter modifications. Furthermore, the exact solution demonstrates earlier breakthrough and lower breakthrough concentration for larger particles. Among all the pores with different sizes, the ones with intermediate sizes (between the minimum pore size and the particle size) vanish first. Total concentration of all the pores smaller than the particles turns to zero asymptotically when time tends to infinity, which corresponds to complete plugging of smaller pores. © 2013 Z.

Innovation in the public sector has been even more neglected in the mainstream of innovation studies. This paper explores the scope for fruitful integration of work on this topic into innovation studies more generally. It examines four different theoretical perspectives used in studies of service innovation: assimilation, demarcation, inversion and integration/synthesis. Each of these throws light on particular issues confronting public services innovation, and we see that innovation in this sphere is highly diverse and that it does often display special features. But we conclude that these features do not constitute a strong case for studying public service innovation as if it were something sui generis, let alone continuing to neglect it. Instead, the case is made for developing more integrative views of innovation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Innovation; Public services","innovation; public service; research; theoretical study",,,,,,,0954349X,,,"English","Struct.

The apraxia classification developed by Luria, the classification of movements widely discussed in neurocognitive tradition, and Bernstein's level structure of the motor act are presented schematically. The strengths and limitations of each of these scientific schools are discussed. The principles of apraxia assessment in Luria's and the neurocognitive framework are analyzed. We conclude that Luria's approach and the neurocognitive tradition of apraxia investigation are quite similar. Bernstein's ideas were formed more than fifty years ago, but seem insightful and fruitful today. According to Bernstein, voluntary movements have some essential features that are not currently taken under consideration. From his point of view, movements are meaningful (determined by a motor task), holistic, hierarchic, dynamic and creative. These postulates were discussed in many of his now-classic works. At the same time we must confess that they are not widely known among clinicians. That is why we believe that Bernstein's concepts can significantly enrich our knowledge in the neuropsychology of praxis.","Apraxia assessment; Bernstein; Level theory of motor acts; Luria; Neurocognitive models of praxis","apraxia; brain function; brain region; clinical research; cognition; comparative study; feedback system; human; manual kinesthetic apraxia; mental function; motor performance; neuropsychology; research; review; Russian Federation; theory; voluntary movement",,,,,,,17307503,,,"English","Acta Neuropsychol.",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892386022

The problem of service integration challenges modern companies taking the risk of implementing SOA. One of important aspects of this problem relates to dynamic service composition, which has to take into account many types of information and restrictions existing in each enterprise. Moreover, all the changes in business logic should also be promptly reflected. This chapter proposes the approach to solution of the stated problem based on such concepts as model-driven architecture (MDA), ontology modelling and logical analysis. The approach consists of several steps of modelling and finite scope logical analysis for automated translation of business processes into the sequence of service invocations. Formal language of relational logic is proposed as a key element of the proposed approach which is responsible for logical analysis and service workflow generation. We present a logical theory to automatically specialize generic orchestration templates which are close to semantic specification of abstract services in OWL-S. The developed logical theory is described formally in terms of Relational Logic. Our approach is implemented and tested using MIT Alloy Analyzer software. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.","Composition; Formal analysis; Information systems; Relational logic; Web-service","Automated translation; Dynamic composition; Dynamic service composition; Formal analysis; Model-Driven architecture; Relational logic; Semantic specification; Service integration; Chemical analysis; Formal languages; Industry; Information services; Semantics; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Software architecture; Software testing; Information systems",,,,,,,21941009,,,"English","Springer Proc.

As the observed behavior is inherently incomplete and models may serve different purposes, four competing quality dimensions-fitness, precision, simplicity, and generalization-have to be balanced to produce a process model of high quality. In this paper, we investigate the discovery of processes that are specified as services. Given a service S and observed behavior of a service P interacting with S, we discover a service model of P. Our algorithm balances the four quality dimensions based on user preferences. Moreover, unlike existing discovery approaches, we guarantees that the composition of S and P is deadlock free. The service discovery technique has been implemented in ProM and experiments using service models of industrial size demonstrate the scalability or our approach. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",,"Deadlock free; Deadlock freedom; Industrial size; Process Discovery; Process Modeling; Quality dimension; Service discovery; Service Model; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Quality of service","IBM Research;SOAMED;Berlin's First University;SerTech;ACM",,"11th International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing, ICSOC 2013","2 December 2013 through 5 December 2013","Berlin",101864,03029743,9783642450044,,"English","Lect.

Mainstream workflow management systems predominantly use procedural languages having a graphical representation involving AND/XOR splits and joins (e.g., using BPMN). However, there are interesting alternative approaches. For example, case handling approaches are data-driven and allow users to deviate within limits, and declarative languages based on temporal logic (where everything is allowed unless explicitly forbidden). Recently, Rinus Plasmeijer proposed the iTask system (iTasks) based on the viewpoint that workflow modeling is in essence a particular kind of functional programming. This provides advantages in terms of expressiveness, extendibility, and implementation efficiency. On the occasion of his 61st birthday, we compare four workflow paradigms: procedural, case handling, declarative, and functional. For each paradigm we selected a characteristic workflow management system: YAWL (procedural), BPM|one (case handling), Declare (declarative), and iTasks (functional). Each of these systems aims to describe and support business processes in an elegant manner. However, there are significant differences. In this paper, we aim to identify and discuss these differences. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Business Process Management; Case Handling; Declarative Languages; Functional Programming; Workflow Management","Business process management; Case handling; Declarative Languages; Graphical representations; Procedural languages; Workflow management systems; Workflow managements; Workflow modeling; Administrative data processing; Enterprise resource management; Work simplification; Functional programming",,,,,,,03029743,9783642403545,,"English","Lect.

However, there are the limitations, which do not make it operable and effective in practice. This investigation attempts to eliminate some limitations of the approach. The NIS is presented as three interrelated macro blocs: business environment, environment producing new knowledge, and knowledge transfer mechanism. The principles of performance and efficiency measuring of NIS are proposed. The system structure-object and functional approaches to NIS performance and efficiency are applied. The former is used for decomposition of NIS objects of high aggregation level. The latter is available for analysis of NIS efficiency and its factors. The methods allow the estimation of the NIS component by component and identification of the cause-effect chains of factor impacts on its elements. The key policy tools tailored to liquidate and mitigate market failure and NIS dysfunctions are proposed. © 2014 by IGI Global.

Simple parameterization of tsunami source through an earthquake magnitude is used to calculate the run-up height versus earthquake magnitude.

The paper begins by describing the current cultural and immigrant diversity in Russia, and then provides a short description of Russian immigrants and the social and psychological problems that immigrants and the larger society face. We present the conceptual framework and findings from empirical studies that examine the reciprocal acculturation and intercultural relations between migrants and members of the larger society. We analyze these studies with respect to their relevance to three hypotheses that have been advanced for examining intercultural relations: the multiculturalism hypothesis; the integration hypothesis; and contact hypothesis. Findings of the studies showed that measures of security, identity, perceived threat/discrimination have a significant relationship with ethnic tolerance, mutual attitudes, acculturation strategies and expectations, and the well-being and life satisfaction of both immigrants and members of the larger society. The results of these studies support all three hypotheses in both groups. The authors concluded that the efforts to improve relations between members of the larger society and immigrants should be directed at enhancing the basic sense of security and at developing programs that increase multicultural attitudes, ethnocultural competence, and tolerance between both groups. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.","Acculturation; Acculturation strategies and expectations; Equality; Immigrants; Immigration; Life satisfaction/security; Perceived threat; Tolerance",,,,,,,,10169040,,,"English","Eur.

The study is conducted against the backdrop of certain assumptions regarding the cross-cultural centrality and marginality of emotions as formulated in the current research on cross-cultural pragmatics. The paper employs corpus-based methods to test the frequencies of the linguistic expression of different types of emotions in Russian and American English as encountered in diagnostic contexts of first-person reporting. Contrary to many currently accepted theories, the present study demonstrates no absolute prevalence of positive or ethical over negative or non-ethical emotions in Russian or American English. It also disproves certain more specific claims (the predominance of 'pity' in Russian), while confirming others (prominence of 'shame' in Russian). Certain tendencies in emotional etiquette lean toward cross-cultural universality (e.g., 'gratitude' as the most frequently expressed emotion), while others differ. Overall, Russian speakers tend to report more passive negative emotions ('fear'), while English speakers prefer reporting active negative emotions ('anger'). Russian speakers are more ""self-deprecating"" than English speakers, as they favor expressing 'shame' over 'pride.' At the same time, they show less empathy with the addressee, reporting more 'contempt'-like and less 'pity'-like emotions. The results obtained in this study can be useful for understanding and formulating culturally specific pragmatic peculiarities and hence preferred conversational strategies in the two languages. © 2013 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.","corpus research; emotion cluster; emotion subtype; emotional etiquette; etiquette maxim; frequency",,,"Walter de Gruyter GmbH",,,,,1612295X,,,"English","Intercult.

Time series of surface elevation, which are measured at a single point, provide incomplete information about the waves. The registered time series are used to restore the wave dynamics under reasonable assumptions. Different frameworks associated with the relation between the surface elevation and the fluid velocity fields are considered, and different numerical models are used to simulate the wave dynamics in time and space. It is shown that for some abnormal or rogue wave records the result of the extreme event reconstruction is robust. In particular, the verification of approximate approaches versus the fully nonlinear numerical simulation is performed. The reconstructed rogue wave is generally less steep than the measured one.

Since 2010 the government has conducted a kind of «incumbent» policy approach, encouraging mainly the largest state-owned companies. The latter are obliged to elaborate and implement innovation development programmes (IDPs) in order to accelerate modernization of the Russian economy and increase demand for innovation. This paper analyzes the results of the monitoring of STI activities undertaken by the state-owned companies in relation to implementation of innovative development programmes. It evaluates the interim results of government initiatives to foster innovation in the related business segment, notes the negative effects of excessive «compulsion» to innovate and provides recommendations for improving policy. Monitoring shows that the actual priority for most companies is modernization of fixed assets through acquisition of modern machinery and equipment. Technology adoption, along with R&D investments, significantly surpasses other possible mechanisms encouraging innovative development (including support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), education and training in innovation, co-operation with other actors in the framework of technology platforms, venture funding). The innovation outputs of the surveyed group of companies are in fact comparable to the Russian average although monitoring does not allow the assessment of corporate patent strategies or the novelty of innovative products that are produced and exported. The author argues that the fundamental policy effect through organizational changes and investments may manifest itself in the next decade. However, the quality of the corporate management, employee loyalty to structural change and organisational culture that supports innovation, would likely be more important in enhancing overall performance. Policy recommendations include: differentiation of government incentives according to the companies' specificities, development of their external linkages with SMEs and universities, linking innovation strategies to corporate policies, and integration of IDPs into the roadmaps of technological development of Russian regions and markets.","Coercion to innovation; Innovation performance; Innovative development programme; State-owned company",,,,,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887037228

Some specialists suggest that in the future machines can become the principal creator of new technologies and race far ahead of humanity. However, emerging technologies for human enhancement offer new possibilities for humans to remain competitive against machines and to acquire more advanced physical and mental capacities. These techniques are interdisciplinary, drawing primarily on advances in medicine, pharmacology, nutrition, mobile communications, neuroscience and cognitive sciences. This paper provides examples of such developments, analyzes their contribution to the expansion of human capabilities and, consequently, implications for the future working environment. It addresses ethical issues and risks associated with human enhancement technologies, in particular, the emergence of the new social divide - between the users of such technologies and people lacking access to them. Finally, it discusses some wild cards that may cause future surprises and shocks, i.e. machines that can control a human-excluded world, a virtual level of human life that dominates real life. The author notes that such conditions will require rethinking established views of personality, human responsibility and mutual obligations that will help the establishment of new behavioral patterns.","Cognitive tools; Human enhancement technologies; Implantable devices; Medicine technologies; Robotics; Social divide; Wearable technologies; Wild cards",,,,,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884513672

Since 2010 in Russia, an initiative has been undertaken to establish a National Software Platform (a set of applications based on Open Source) which, it is presumed, will be compulsorily embedded into the system of public administration. The paper assesses the efficiency of government policy in the field of Open Source and provides recommendations for its improvement. Analyzing the specifics of the software market, that is, comparing the strengths and weaknesses of the two main types of software - proprietary («closed»), and open - As well as «extreme» types in regard to the latter (direct stimulation or complete disengagement of the government from regulating the users' choice), the authors conclude that any extreme policy approach is hardly relevant to the considered field. One should take into account the development not only of the software, but also the whole complex of complementary assets that are factors in the economic impact of innovation. The joint work of suppliers and customers in introducing new technologies (co-invention) creates a synergy that is the key to the effective use of ICT in the economy and development of the sector as a whole. Therefore, protectionism (fostering manufacturers at the cost of limiting consumer choice) is fundamentally inconsistent with the specifics of the ICT industry, and the compulsory transition to the new type of software will lead to a significant loss in terms of «switching costs» and benefits of network effects. At the same time, the indirect measures, including information sharing and support for users of open standards, expands customer choice and reduces the costs of switching from one to another software type. It is these mechanisms that are not just compatible with the specifics of the market, but also allow maximum benefits, both for producers and consumers.","Co-invention; Information and communication technologies; Network effects; Open source software; Proprietary software; Switching costs; Virtual networks",,,,,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887051072

This paper conceptualizes about an architectural framework specifically designed for explaining and representing the working environment of enterprise operating systems (EOS) and non-EOS information systems (IS) that depend on it. With these concerns in mind, the goal of EOS is to capture and control all phenomena that occur in an organization and then to provide all the required data for all IS for that organization. Using a computer engineering metaphor, this paper defines the theoretical foundations, and the methodology to design and implement an operating system for organizations. To achieve this, EOS is a model-driven dynamically. The models are based on domain ontology with C4-ness qualities and expressed in ontological language. It will be shown that the theory of enterprise ontology and the DEMO methodology provide a high degree of ontological appropriateness for this domain. This paper, outline a framework with its foundations, concepts, principles and stratification of IS, which is a radical new approach, useful to discussion this solution among the practitioners. A methodology to apply this architectural framework is discussed using a professional production case management.

Its future milestones lie in two key dimensions: social - combating common and complex diseases, and economic - establishing S&T basis that will provide leadership, or at least a decent niche in the global markets. The paper provides the results of a study conducted by the HSE in cooperation with the member organizations of technology platform ""Medicine of the Future"". It supposes and empirically tests the feasibility of matching challenges and responses aimed at selecting the priorities of S&T development. The study identified underlying trends and S&T areas that will shape the medium and long term prospects of medicine, as well as backlogs allowing gaining strong global market positions. The possible technology responses for the most significant healthcare challenges for Russia are identified, and a priority research agenda is proposed. The authors conclude that Russia lacks breakthrough S&T capacities in the majority of promising medical areas. Meanwhile, domestic advances in some fields still offer the chance for a breakthrough and gaining solid positions on global markets as well as for integration in the value chain. Time to catch up with these opportunities however is running out: most of them are estimated to be available only for the next 5-7 years, so urgent actions are required.

Another aim is to propose an outline for the globalization measurement methodology that would take a systemic approach to revealing the global flows (both their direction and content) and networks, which will allow the multidimensionality in globalization measurement crucial for proposing and verifying formal explanations and hypotheses, as well as for developing globalization forecasts. – Several methodologies for globalization measurements are compared in the paper, among the most important are variations of the index compilation methodology, and methods of network analysis. – For Global Studies curricula, globalization measurement tools much more complex than indices are needed. A possible solution could lie in the analysis of country-to-country flows (and networks which these flows form), which appears much more data- and effort-consuming than the methodologies behind the index compilation, will allow the elaboration of a systemic vision of globalization and the interactions between its various aspects, which should necessarily underlie the Global Studies curricula. – The research concentrates upon the most widespread approaches to globalization measurements, such as the most widely recognized globalization indices, and the few attempts at country-to-country flows and networks measurement. – The paper's originality/value lies in proposing an outline for a new multidimensional approach to measuring globalization based upon country-to-country flows and networks. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Codes; Global networks; Globalization; Globalization indices; Globalization measurement; Social systems; Strategic planning; Systems theory; Teaching methods",,,,,,,,10650741,,,"English","Campus-Wide Inf.

The goal of the policy was to improve the quality of intercultural relations. Two main elements of the policy were proposed as steps towards achieving this goal: support for the maintenance and development of cultural communities (the cultural component); and promotion of intercultural contact along with the reduction of barriers to such participation (the intercultural component). Research on these issues can provide a basis for the development and implementation of multiculturalism policies and programmes. A review of psychological research on multiculturalism over the past 40 years is summarised. Topics include: knowledge about the multiculturalism policy; acceptance of multiculturalism; acceptance of ethnocultural groups; acceptance of immigrants; discrimination and exclusion; and attachment and identity. Research assessing three hypotheses derived from the policy is also briefly reviewed. Current evidence is that there is widespread support for these features of the multicultural way of living in Canada. Of particular importance for the success of multiculturalism is the issue of social cohesion: is the first component (the promotion of cultural diversity) compatible with the second component (the full and equitable participation and inclusion of all ethnocultural groups in civic society)? If they are compatible, together do they lead to the attainment of the fundamental goal of attaining positive intercultural relations? Current psychological evidence suggests that these two components are indeed compatible, and that when present, they are associated with mutual acceptance among ethnocultural groups in Canada. I conclude that research in Canada supports the continuation of the multiculturalism policy and programmes that are intended to improve intercultural relations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Acculturation; Contact; Cultural maintenance; Ethnocultural groups; Immigrants; Intercultural relations; Public attitudes; Public policy; Social cohesion",,,,,,,,01471767,,,"English","Int.

We argue that Hegel's theory of Objective Spirit anticipates many elements of modern approaches in cognitive sciences and of the philosophy of mind, which adopt an externalist framework. In particular, Hegel pre-empts the theories of social and distributed cognition. The pivotal elements of Hegelian social ontology are the continuity thesis, the performativity thesis, and the recognition thesis, which, when taken together, imply that all mental processes are essentially dependent on externalizations, with the underlying pattern of actions being performative. In turn, performative action is impossible without mutual recognition in an intersubjective domain. We demonstrate the implications for economic theory in sketching an externalist approach to institutions and preferences. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Extended mind; Hegel; Institutional economics; Performativity; Preferences; Recognition",,,,,,,,15937879,,,"English","Mind Soc.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885855218

Meanwhile, it is a challenging problem because it involves a large amount of integer variables. With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in power systems, power system operations and control have been more affected by uncertainties than before. This paper discusses a stochastic unit commitment model which takes into account various uncertainties affecting thermal energy demand and two types of power generators, i.e., quick-start and non-quick-start generators. This problem is a stochastic mixed integer program with discrete decision variables in both first and second stages. In order to solve this difficult problem, a method based on Benders decomposition is applied. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm can solve the stochastic unit commitment problem efficiently, especially those with large numbers of scenarios. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Benders decomposition; Energy; Mixed integer subproblem; Stochastic mixed integer programming; Two-stage stochastic unit commitment",,,,,,,,02545330,,,"English","Ann.

As a result, the impact of the break-up of the Soviet Union on infant mortality in the region is not known, and proper monitoring of mortality levels is impaired. In this paper, a variety of data sources and methods are used to assess levels of infant mortality and their trend over time in one Central Asian republic, Kyrgyzstan, between 1980 and 2010. An abrupt halt to an already established decline in infant mortality was observed to occur during the decade following the break-up of the Soviet Union, contradicting the official statistics based on vital registration. Infants of Central Asian ethnicity and those born in rural areas were also considerably more at risk of mortality than suggested by the official sources. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for health policy in this seldom studied part of the former Soviet Union and for our understanding of the health crisis which it currently faces. © 2013 Population Investigation Committee.","Central Asia; data quality; former Soviet Union; indirect estimation techniques; infant mortality; Kyrgyzstan","data quality; estimation method; ethnicity; health care; infant mortality; rural area; Central Asia; Kyrgyzstan; USSR; article; demography; human; infant; infant mortality; Kyrgyzstan; life expectancy; USSR; Demography; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Kyrgyzstan; Life Expectancy; USSR",,,,,,,00324728,,POSTA,"English","Popul.

The problem is treated as a statistical task of parameter estimation for a general type multidimensional linear model with random or completely unknown input time functions. The maximum-likelihood generic estimators are derived and their relationship with the well-known seismic emission tomography (SET) algorithm is established. The proposed estimation algorithms perform processing of multichannel discrete observations in the frequency domain and can be implemented in on-line mode. Using the method of successive independent trials (Monte-Carlo), we demonstrate that a proposed statistical estimation algorithm provides much higher accuracy of the micro-seismic event source location in real noise conditions than the widely used SET algorithm and, as a consequence, is more reliable in practical applications. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Asymptotically efficient estimator; Hydraulic fracturing; Maximum-likelihood estimator; Micro-seismic source; Multichannel signal processing","Asymptotically efficient; Discrete observations; Emission tomography; Estimation algorithm; Micro-seismic; Multi-channel signal processing; Multichannel data; Statistical estimation; Algorithms; Estimation; Hydraulic fracturing; Signal processing; Transients; Seismology; algorithm; geostatistics; hydraulic fracture; maximum likelihood analysis; monitoring; Monte Carlo analysis; seismic data; seismic method; seismic noise; seismic source; seismic tomography",,,,,,,18692672,,,"English","GEM - Intl.

The spectrum has fourfold degeneracy at the top of the two-dimensional Brillouin zone (M point) and twofold degeneracy near the M point. Crystal symmetry along with the time reversal invariance in three-dimensional topological insulators allows fourfold degenerate Dirac cones, which are absent in the classification of topological features in R.-J. Slager et al., Nat. Phys. 9, 98 (2013). The Hamiltonian in the cited work does not contain Dirac singularities with more than twofold degeneracy. For this reason, the corresponding topological classification is incomplete. The longitudinal magnetic field in the spinless case holds the massless dispersion law of fermions and does not lift fourfold degeneracy. In the spinor case, the magnetic field lifts fourfold degeneracy, holding only twofold degeneracy, and results in the appearance of a band gap in the spectrum of fermions. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",,,,,,,,,00213640,,,"English","JETP Lett.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887289960

The data allow tracing key trends in fisheries development and in the abundance of major commercial species. In particular, results showed that, over time, the main fishing areas moved from the middle part of rivers downstream towards and onto the coastal sea. Changes in fishing patterns were closely interrelated with changes in the abundance of exploited fish. Anadromous species, such as Atlantic sturgeon, Atlantic salmon, brown trout, whitefish, vimba bream, smelt, lamprey, and catadromous eel were the most important commercial fish in the area because they were abundant, had high commercial value and were easily available for fishing in rivers. Due to intensive exploitation and other human-induced factors, populations of most of these species had declined notably by the early 20th century and have now lost commercial significance. The last sturgeon was caught in 1996, and today only smelt and lamprey support small commercial fisheries. According to historical sources, catches of freshwater species such as roach, ide, pike, perch, ruffe and burbot regularly occurred, in some areas exceeding half of the total catch, but they were not as important as migrating fish and no clear trends in abundance are apparent. Of documented marine catch, Baltic herring appeared in the 16th century, but did not become commercially significant until the 19th century. From then until now herring have been the dominant catch. © 2013 Lajus et al.",,"article; Baltic Sea; coastal waters; commercial phenomena; environmental exploitation; Finland; fishery; freshwater fish; history; population abundance; population density; river basin; Animals; Baltic States; Bays; Ecosystem; Finland; Fisheries; Fishes; Geography; History, 15th Century; History, 16th Century; History, 17th Century; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Human Activities; Humans; Oceans and Seas; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Rivers",,,,,,,19326203,,POLNC,"English","PLoS ONE",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886302574

However, this effect is reciprocal: companies that generate higher cash flow can invest more in IC. The purpose of this paper is to analyze a dynamic relationship between IC components and economic profit, with a special emphasis on industry specific effects in pharmaceutical, retail, steel, telecommunications, and service sectors. Design/methodology/approach: Panel vector autoregression was used to deal with the mutual influence of IC components, the lag effect, and heterogeneity. The data were taken from Compustat database and covers the period from 2001 to 2010. Findings: The paper proves that there is interaction between investments in the IC components and company performance. However, there are sectoral differences: there is a positive impact of economic profit on human capital in retail; in the steel industry a mutual influence is revealed. Moreover, interaction between different IC components is detected in telecommunication and steel industries. Originality/value: This is the first study to present clear evidence of the effects of performance on IC investment decisions. The time lag in the effects of IC investments was estimated and compared for different industries. On the methodological side, the paper presents a rather simple method capable of yielding results consistent with other studies and yet rich enough to be applied to an analysis of sectoral differences in dynamic IC investment decisions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Financial performance; Intellectual capital; Interaction effect; Vector autoregression",,,,,,,,14691930,,,"English","J.

An approach to estimate the exact number of attributes and the parameters of the model in a given class of utility functions for each attribute was proposed. The estimation is derived through the optimization of corrected Akaike information criterion, where the parameters of the utility function are continuous and the number of attributes is integer and positive.

Thus, the immediate motivation of the present paper is to develop a systematic procedure to study, classify, and visualize possible textures in biaxial nematics. Based on the elastic energy of a biaxial nematic (written in the most simple form that involves the least number of phenomenological parameters) we derive and solve numerically the Lagrange equations of the first kind. It allows one to visualize the solutions and offers a deep insight into their geometrical and topological features. Performing Fourier analysis we find some particular textures possessing two or more characteristic space periods (we term such solutions quasiperiodic ones because the periods are not necessarily commensurate).

Also, Kyrgyzstan's mortality fluctuations have had smaller amplitude. This has occurred in spite of worse macro-economic outcomes in Kyrgyzstan. To understand these surprising patterns, we analyzed cause-specific mortality in Kyrgyzstan vs. Russia for the period 1981-2010, using unpublished official data. We find that, as in Russia, fluctuations in Kyrgyzstan have been primarily due to changes in external causes and circulatory causes, and alcohol appears to play an important role. However, in contrast with Russia, mortality from these causes in Kyrgyzstan has been lower and has increased by a smaller amount. As a result, the mortality gap between the two countries is overwhelmingly attributable to external and cardio-vascular causes, and more generally, to causes that have been shown to be strongly related to alcohol consumption. These cause-specific results, together with the existence of large ethnic differentials in mortality in Kyrgyzstan, highlight the importance of cultural and religious differences, and their impact on patterns of alcohol consumption, in explaining the mortality gap between the two countries. These findings show that explanatory frameworks relying solely on macro-economic factors are not sufficient for understanding differences in mortality levels and trends among former Soviet republics. © 2013 Guillot et al.",,"adult; alcohol consumption; article; Asia; biostatistics; cardiovascular disease; cause of death; Central Asia; cultural factor; economic aspect; ethnic difference; human; mortality; religion; Russian Federation; trend study; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholism; Cause of Death; Female; Humans; Kyrgyzstan; Life Expectancy; Male; Mortality; Russia",,,,,,,19326203,,POLNC,"English","PLoS ONE",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885141206

By mapping of local continuous feature vectors to a discrete range, this problem is reduced to statistical classification of a set of discrete finite patterns. It is demonstrated that the Bayesian decision under the assumption that probability distributions can be estimated using the Parzen kernel and the Gaussian window with a fixed variance for all the classes, implemented in the PNN, is not optimal in the classification of a set of patterns. We presented here the novel modification of the PNN with homogeneity testing which gives an optimal solution of the latter task under the same assumption about probability densities. By exploiting the discrete nature of patterns our modification prevents the well-known drawbacks of the memory-based approach implemented in both the PNN and the PNN with homogeneity testing, namely, low classification speed and high requirements to the memory usage. Our modification only requires the storage and processing of the histograms of input and training samples. We present the results of an experimental study in two practically important tasks: (1) the problem of Russian text authorship attribution with character n-grams features; and (2) face recognition with well-known datasets (AT&T, FERET and JAFFE) and comparison of color- and gradient-orientation histograms.

One such property is the fact that the discriminant is always a hypersurface in the space of systems of equations (which seems unexpected when compared to the existence of dual defect toric varieties). This fact reflects the combinatorics of a certain partial order relation on the set of tuples of faces of a tuple of polytopes (the Newton polytopes of the equations in our case), generalizing the poset of faces of one polytope. This combinatorics is the main challenge in our work, and can be reduced to a certain fact of tropical geometry, which resembles the geometry of the discriminants that we study. As a sample application of our version of the multivariate discriminant, we prove that atypical fibers of a generic polynomial map are distinguished by their Euler characteristics, and the bifurcation set of such a map is a hypersurface, whose degree we explicitly compute. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Bifurcation set; Discriminant; Dual defect; Polytope; Purity; Tropical geometry",,,,,,,,00018708,,,"English","Adv.

The main drawback of such ratings is that they only provide a linear ordering of countries by averaging a multitude of criteria. Such approach does not make it obvious which particular problems exist in which countries and thus does not help comparing democratic processes in different countries. In this paper, we propose a multidimensional model for ratings based on the mathematical discipline of formal concept analysis, which deals, in particular, with automated taxonomy construction from object-attribute data. In our case, every node of a taxonomy would group countries similar in certain aspects, while at the same time providing a description of these aspects. The aim is not to question the existing ratings, but rather to provide a neutral instrument for uncovering the structure of the data underlying these ratings. The proposed representation is much more informative than linear ratings, since it shows the commonalities and differences in the democratic development of various countries. In addition, it provides a solid ground for discussing, comparing, and criticizing ratings. It can also help formulate theoretical hypotheses on the evolution of democracy, thereby advancing scientific discovery. We illustrate the proposed representation with the case study of countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. © 2013 CEEUN.","Conceptual hierarchies; Democracy ratings; Formal concept analysis; Multidimensional model",,,,,,,,16144007,,,"English","Transit.

The details of this government initiative, however, still remain unclear, as do specific implementation arrangements. The paper provides the results of focus groups, held by the Higher School of Economics, in order to identify potential parameters of efficient contract modeling in the R&D sector. The discussions involved representatives from the State Academies of Sciences, universities and government research centers. Among issues raised were the organization of labor and remuneration system in the R&D sector, productivity of scientific activities, institutional conditions for a transition to «efficient contracts», and factors affecting the loyalty of researchers. Major conclusions presented in the paper include recommendations for salaries and for the research remuneration system for R&D personnel. In the authors' view, one of the key parameters of an efficient research contract should be a «fair» minimum salary guaranteed by the government. Another recommendations in reference to R&D evaluation is that efficient contracts should guarantee not only fair rewards but also competitive selection in order to prevent an excessive inflow of the workforce from other sectors of the economy. Finally, the paper discusses problems of funding and the institutional development of the R&D sector. In the authors' view, it will hardly be possible to build a high-performing system of efficient contracts without implementing profound reforms restructuring the R&D sector («selection of the best»), improving the funding system (finding additional sources of investment, streamlining the operation of public science foundations), modernizing the physical infrastructure, and arranging for the conservation of Russian scientific schools and attracting young talent.","Efficient contract; Pay-for-performance; R&D evaluation; Remuneration system; Researcher; S&T policy",,,,,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884523039

This paper studies the dynamics of key characteristics of the academic profession in Russia. We use data on Russian university faculty from two large-scale comparative studies of the academic profession (the «International Academic Profession», a study carried out by the Carnegie Center in 1992 in 14 countries, including Russia [Altbach, 1996], and the «Changing Academic Profession», a study implemented in 2007, with 19 participating countries, including Russia, in 2012 [Teichler et al., 2013]) to look at how faculty attitudes on aspects of academic life changed over 20 years (1992-2012): for instance faculty views on reasons for leaving or staying at the university, on university management and on the faculty's role in decision making. We also use the international dataset from the «Changing Academic Profession» to compare Russian faculty to those in other countries. The article provides an analysis of teaching/research preferences, views on the personal strain associated with work, and academic career perspectives for Russian universities (1992 and 2012) in comparison with those of other countries. One of the main conclusions is that the high degree of overall centralization of governance in Russian universities has barely changed in 20 years. This undermines talk of universities' shift towards academic self-governance. The basic attitudes of university faculties are in many ways the same over twenty years, although perception of the mission of higher education has changed. Previously the mission was to prepare students for a successful professional career, now the priority is seen in strengthening the country's position at the international level. One can hardly argue, however, that universities are in a position to implement this new mission.","Academic contracts; Academic profession; Higher education; Research and teaching nexus; Research universities; University governance",,,,,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884514202

The focus of public support is shifting from funding current activities of universities towards rewarding outcomes. There are, as a result, many strategies to adapt and develop universities in this changing environment. For example, emerging typologies for structuring a network of higher education institutions (HEIs) taking into account their diversity are at the forefront in many countries of agendas for greater efficiency in higher education. We advance a typology for HEIs in Russia taking into account indicators of research and teaching activities. We present an overview of best practices for HEIs, some typologies, a set of indicators and mathematical tools for constructing a typology of Russian public HEIs. This typology is based on clustering the input (resource allocation) and output (performance) indicators that characterize academic and educational achievements of HEIs. The proposed classification differentiates types of universities and contains a decision tree that allows assigning universities to one category or another. It can be used as a basis for a comprehensive analysis of diverse Russian universities and for government policies to address each of the identified HEI types, depending on their characteristics.","Hierarchical clustering; Higher education institutions (HEIs); Research and education activities of HEIs; Typology",,,,,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884509524

The tsunami wave attacked the Oarai port of Ibaraki prefecture within 30 minutes, and created an enormous vortex flow within the harbor. A similar feature was observed in the Imwon port, in the Eastern Korean coast during the 1983 tsunami event in the East (Japan) Sea. A set of simulations have been performed to investigate the generation of the powerful vortex caused by the 2011 tsunami event at the Oarai Port. The application of numerical models has successfully reproduced the formation of the vortex in the center of the port, which can be clearly identified in a photograph taken during the tsunami. The simulation of tsunami generation and propagation at the outer sea is performed with a hydrostatic model and, for the investigation of a more detailed transient pattern of water flows, the model which uses full Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations is applied. Examination of the Oarai and Imwon vortexes implies that the generation and strength of a vortex due to tsunami wave is strongly related in the size and the shape of port and breakwater layouts. The present work indicates that time-variation the inflow through the mouth of a harbor controls the transient pattern of the vortex. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.","2011 East Japan earthquake; Tsunami induced vortex; Tsunami numerical modeling","breakwater; computational fluid dynamics; earthquake event; harbor; inflow; Navier-Stokes equations; numerical model; port; Reynolds number; three-dimensional modeling; tsunami; vortex; wave runup; Honshu; Ibaraki; Iwate; Japan; Kanto; Oarai; Pacific Coast [Japan]; Tohoku",,,,,,,07490208,,JCRSE,"English","J.

The minimum size of the small asteroid is determined by the ability to detect it and to determine its orbit. Near-Earth asteroids (NEA's) are selected from those that have a fly-by distance from Earth of the order of hundreds of thousands of kilometers. According to current estimates, the number of near Earth asteroids with such sizes is very large, making it possible to find the required small asteroid. Further, the possibility is evaluated of changing the small asteroid's orbit so that, by application of a very limited ΔV impulse, the object is targeted to a gravity assist maneuver (Earth swingby) that puts it on a collision course with a dangerous asteroid. In order to apply the required ΔV impulse, it is necessary to install on the small asteroid an appropriate propulsion system with required propellant mass. A control system similar to that used on a spacecraft is also necessary. The Keck study has already shown the feasibility of performing the above steps to change the orbit of similar asteroids to target them to a lunar orbit; our idea is similar in orbital energetics to that, only for slightly larger objects and targeting them to an Earth B-plane point rather than the vicinity of the Moon. Of course, any real test of this (or of any other deflection) strategy should first be performed on a benign asteroid whose orbital parameters give the asteroid no significant chance of a natural impact with the Earth during at least the next million years, even in the case of small changes in its orbit.",,"Basic concepts; Collision course; Current estimates; Gravity assist maneuvers; Near-earth asteroids; Orbital parameters; Propellant mass; Propulsion system; Flight control systems; Moon; Orbits; Asteroids","Draper Laboratory",,"AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) Conference","19 August 2013 through 22 August 2013","Boston, MA",99256,,9781624102240,,"English","AIAA Guidance, Navigation, Control (GNC) Conf.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883667817

Because of its success, a short version of the PVQ was introduced in the European Social Survey (ESS). However, initial tests using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) pointed to low discriminant validity of the 10 basic values: The correlations between values next to each other in the two-dimensional space described by SSA were close to or greater than 1. In response, one research stream suggested combining the factors with low discriminant validity. Another stream suggested that the problem was not low discriminant validity but rather misspecifications in the model. Analyses of the short Portrait Values Questionnaire of the ESS confirmed the latter view. This paper demonstrates that the problems of the short version of the PVQ exist in the full 40-item PVQ as well. Based on SEM analyses of the items of the full PVQ, we propose that it can provide measures of 15 more narrowly defined values with good discriminant validity. Our proposal respects the conceptual complexity of the values theory while avoiding contamination of composite scores. It can be expected that the improved measurement of 15 values will increase their predictive power. The presence of some single items suggests the extension of the value theory and scales to encompass more than 15 values. Implications for further development of the scale are drawn. © European Survey Research Association.","CFA; Composite scores; Human values; Portrait Values Questionnaire; Validity",,,,,,,,18643361,,,"English","Surv.

We show that a non-parameterized preference is a special case of a parameterized preference, while any parameterized preference can be represented by an exponentially large set of non-parameterized preferences. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","ceteris paribus preferences; formal concept analysis; implications; preference logic","Ceteris paribus; Consequence relations; Context-based semantics; Formal contexts; implications; Parameterized; Preference logic; Information analysis; Parameterization; Semantics; Formal concept analysis",,,"11th International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis, ICFCA 2013","21 May 2013 through 24 May 2013","Dresden",99228,03029743,9783642383168,,"English","Lect.

WTO commitments will progressively and significantly lower the applied tariffs of the Russian Federation. Russian tariffs will ultimately fall to between 45 and 68 percent of their pre-accession levels, with the larger fall being on a weighted average, rather than an unweighted average basis. Nonetheless, bound tariffs will exceed applied tariffs for almost 1,500 tariff lines.

After 1990, a massive privatization of housing was achieved first through the transfer of stock from industrial companies to municipalities and then through no-cost transfer of ownership to the tenants. Despite privatization, a large amount of housing stock has since been unloaded back onto municipalities who now find themselves owners of 11% of all housing in Russia (much more in some regions). The poor quality of stock and the inability of the new owners to meet maintenance costs have led to a growing housing role for local authorities, who have many new responsibilities and expectations from residents, but few resources. Although the situation has parallels in other post-socialist countries, the scale in Russia is greater, and there is no EU aid, nor any tradition either of ownership or collective responsibility. Economic crisis in Europe and a slow down in housing construction in Russia mean that new policies for rental housing are needed. This review considers historic and recent changes in housing policy in the Russian Federation in light of the emerging housing role of municipal governments. In the review, we draw on national data as well a case study of the city of Perm to illustrate the impact of this transformation.

The cases for bays with triangular (V-shaped bay), parabolic (U-shaped bay), and rectangular cross-sections are discussed in detail. The dynamics of the offshore-propagating wave in linearly inclined bays of different cross-section are also studied asymptotically for the resonant moving landslide.

We consider the possibility that these waves propagate without reflection although there is some inhomogeneity. We briefly describe the general theory of non-reflective, one-dimensional wave propagation in inhomogeneous media. This theory is then applied to kink-wave propagation in coronal loops. We consider a coronal loop of half-circle shape embedded in an isothermal atmosphere, and assume that the plasma temperature is the same inside and outside the loop. We show that non-reflective kink-wave propagation is possible for a particular dependence of the loop radius on the distance along the loop. A viable assumption that the loop radius increases from the loop footpoint to the apex imposes a lower limit on the loop expansion factor, which is the ratio of the loop radii at the apex and footpoints. This lower limit increases with the loop height; however, even for a loop that is twice as high as the atmospheric scale height, it is small enough to satisfy observational constraints. Hence, we conclude that non-reflective propagation of kink waves is possible in a fairly realistic model of coronal loops. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corona; Coronal magnetic loops; Wave reflection; Waves",,,,,,,,00380938,,,"English","Sol.

In another context, the Thoma cone appears as the set of parameters for totally positive, upper triangular Toeplitz matrices of infinite size. The purpose of the paper is to construct a family {X(z;z')} of continuous time Markov processes on the Thoma cone, depending on two continuous parameters z and z'. Our construction largely exploits specific properties of the Thoma cone related to its representation-theoretic origin, although we do not use representations directly. On the other hand, we were inspired by analogies with random matrix theory coming from models of Markov dynamics related to orthogonal polynomial ensembles. We show that processes X(z;z') possess a number of nice properties, namely: (1) every X(z;z') is a Feller process; (2) the infinitesimal generator of X(z;z'), its spectrum, and the eigenfunctions admit an explicit description; (3) in the equilibrium regime, the finite-dimensional distributions of X(z;z') can be interpreted as (the laws of) infinite-particle systems with determinantal correlations; (4) the corresponding time-dependent correlation kernel admits an explicit expression, and its structure is similar to that of time-dependent correlation kernels appearing in random matrix theory.","Determinantal processes; Feller processes; Laguerre polynomials; Markov intertwiners; Meixner polynomials; Thoma cone; Thoma simplex",,,,,,,,10836489,,,"English","Electron.

Control-flow is either modeled explicitly as flow of a specific kind of data, or implicit based on the data-flow. Explicit modeling of control-flow is useful for well-known and highly structured processes, but may make modeling of abstract features of models, or processes which are highly dynamic, overly complex. Declarative modeling, such as is supported by Declare and DCR graphs, focus on control-flow, but does not specify it explicitly; instead specifications come in the form of constraints on the order or appearance of tasks. In this paper we propose a combination of the two, using colored Petri nets instead of plain Petri nets to provide full data support. The combined approach makes it possible to add a focus on data to declarative languages, and to remove focus from the explicit control-flow from Petri nets for dynamic or abstract processes. In addition to enriching both procedural processes in the form of Petri nets and declarative processes, we also support a flow from modeling only abstract data- and control-flow of a model towards a more explicit control-flow model if so desired. We define our combined approach, and provide considerations necessary for enactment.

Although process mining has been applied in hundreds of organizations and process mining techniques have been embedded in a variety of commercial tools, to date these techniques have rarely been used for analyzing web services. One of the obvious reasons is that cross-organizational event data cannot be shared easily. However, (1) messages exchanged between services tend to be structured, (2) service-orientation continues to be the predominant implementation paradigm, and (3) the most substantial efficiency gains can often only be achieved across different organizations. Hence, there are many possible applications for service mining, i.e., applying process mining techniques to services. If messages are recorded, then one can discover a process describing interactions between services. If, in addition, descriptive or normative models are available, one can use process mining to check conformance and highlight performance problems.

The material processing maps were constructed based on the basis of dynamic materials model (DMM) developed by Prassad and modified by Narayana Murty. For the construction of such maps the data of the material flow stress at different temperatures and strain rates is necessary. To obtain such data the stepped tensile tests which allow obtaining the stress - strain rate dependence at a given temperature are ideal. The experiments conducted consist of the tensile test series at various temperatures with stepped change of the deformation rate. By the results of these tests the constitutive equations, which describe relationship between stress and strain rate for each temperature, were obtained. The data was analyzed in terms of the two different approaches proposed by Prassad and Narayana Murty to assess the impact of deformation conditions on the formability and flow stability of the material. Based on these approaches, the processing maps, which enable identifying the conditions of the Ti-6V-4Al alloy superplasticity, were constructed. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Constitutive model; Processing map; Superplasticity; Tensile tests; Ti-6Al-4V","Deformation conditions; Dynamic materials model; Flow charac-teristics; Material processing maps; Processing maps; Strain rate dependence; Stress and strain rate; Ti-6al-4v; Aluminum; Computer simulation; Constitutive models; Deformation; Hot working; Numerical models; Strain rate; Superplasticity; Titanium alloys; Tensile testing","The Federation of Finnish Learned Societies;Dynamic Systems Inc.;Fuji Electronic Industrial Co.

This paper presents examples of modeling of the deformation of a slab with a liquid core. The use of soft reduction can enhance the homogeneity of the structure, which improves the quality of cast billets. Mathematical modeling is described here where the fluid layer is taken into account by the influence of boundary conditions in the crust in the form of ferrostatic pressure, which allows calculation of the intensity of deformation, total deformation and strain. It also provides a novel method for studying the process of soft reduction. It is based on a physical model of the slab consisting of a closed solid shell made of a calibrated lead shot and the Wood's alloy. To simulate the liquid molten metal, the interior of the shell is filled with gelatin. This approach can be applied to further studies on deformation processes and the penetration of deformation into complex metallic systems. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Diameter; Distribution; Liquid core; Mathematical model; Slab; Soft reduction; Sphere; Strain","Diameter; Distribution; Liquid cores; Slab; Soft reduction; Computer simulation; Liquid metals; Mathematical models; Metal forming; Numerical models; Spheres; Strain; Deformation","The Federation of Finnish Learned Societies;Dynamic Systems Inc.;Fuji Electronic Industrial Co.

Tricluster is defined as a dense subset of a ternary relation Y defined on sets of objects, attributes, and conditions, or, equivalently, as a dense submatrix of the adjacency matrix of the ternary relation Y. This definition is a scalable relaxation of the notion of triconcept in Triadic Concept Analysis, whereas each triconcept of the initial data-set is contained in a certain tricluster. This approach generalizes the one previously introduced for concept-based biclustering. We also propose a hierarchical spectral triclustering algorithm for mining dense submatrices of the adjacency matrix of the initial ternary relation Y.

Furthermore, few aphasia tests in languages other than English have been standardised and normed, and few have supportive psychometric data pertaining to reliability and validity. The lack of standardised assessment tools across many of the world's languages poses serious challenges to clinical practice and research in aphasia. Aims: The current review addresses this lack of assessment tools by providing conceptual and statistical guidance for the development of aphasia assessment tools and establishment of their psychometric properties. Main Contribution: A list of aphasia tests in the 20 most widely spoken languages is included. The pitfalls of translating an existing test into a new language versus creating a new test are outlined. Factors to be considered in determining test content are discussed. Further, a description of test items corresponding to different language functions is provided, with special emphasis on implementing important controls in test design. Next, a broad review of principal psychometric properties relevant to aphasia tests is presented, with specific statistical guidance for establishing psychometric properties of standardised assessment tools. Conclusions: This article may be used to help guide future work on developing, standardising and validating aphasia language tests. The considerations discussed are also applicable to the development of standardised tests of other cognitive functions. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Aphasia; Language assessment; Psychometrics; Reliability; Standardised testing; Test development; Validity","aphasia; clinical assessment tool; cognition; human; information dissemination; language ability; language processing; language test; linguistics; psychometry; review; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; speech; test retest reliability; validity; visual stimulation",,,,,,,02687038,,APHAE,"English","Aphasiology",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882269676

The problem reduces to an analysis of families of dynamical processes (when the original equation is defined on the whole time axis) or dynamical semiprocesses (when it is defined on a half-axis). Results are established on the existence of uniform global attractors for families of processes and semiprocesses. The structure of attractors for non-autonomous equations with translation-compact symbols is investigated. Conditions are found under which attractors of semiprocesses reduce to attractors of corresponding processes.

We calculate the leading two-loop infrared contribution to the two-point function in this theory. We do that for the massive fields both from the principal and complementary series. As can be expected at this order, light fields from the complementary series show stronger infrared effects than the heavy fields from the principal one. For the principal series, unlike the complementary one, we can derive the kinetic equation from the system of Dyson-Schwinger equation, which allows us to sum up the leading infrared contributions from all loops. We find two peculiar solutions of the kinetic equation. One of them describes the stationary Gibbons-Hawking-type distribution for the density per comoving volume. Another solution shows explosive (square root of the pole in finite proper time) growth of the particle number density per comoving volume. That signals the possibility of the destruction of the expanding Poincaré patch even by the very massive fields.

Changes also occurred in the organization and working conditions of courts and in realization of justice. The procedure of case preparation for trial had also much improved. However, changes in the legal regulation at case preparation stage date to 2002. Despite the fact that legislator gave a new meaning to this procedure stage and despite the expectation that this procedure stage would play a new role in the process as a whole, many scientists in their research repeatedly considered the preparation stage as the subject of critical analysis. Indeed, large potential of stage of case preparation for trial, as well as the experience of civil procedure in foreign countries, was omitted by legislator. And no matter how insulting it could be, this procedure stage remains to be so for already more than ten years. Therefore, it seems reasonable to consider the very key points in the formation of case preparation as the procedure stage and as an institution of civil procedural law and to indicate the tendencies in the development of rules in this area. ©IDOSI Publications, 2013.","Law reform; Legal activity; Legal regulation",,,,,,,,19909233,,,"English","Middle East J.

Questions about the concept, nature and location of the proceedings in the legal system of the Russian Federation are very controversial, both in terms of science and the practice. Problems in the concerned field of legal regulation have attracted the attention of Russian scientists-processualists as long ago as the XIX century. In the Soviet period, the term ""administrative justice"" was widely used. Today, the legal doctrine of the Russian Federation offers a variety of approaches to understand the essence of the administrative legal proceedings. In particular, certain group of scientists defines it in terms of the bodies authorized to resolve disputes of individuals and organizations with the authorities, the other one defines in terms of administration control of the authorized bodies and the third group suggests considering the concept of ""administrative justice"" in a broad and the narrow sense. Differences in attitudes and ambiguous understanding of this concept in the legal literature is related to the variety of its particular diversities, which derived due to historical, socio-economic and political factors in each country. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.","Administrative justice; Administrative legal proceedings; Cases arising from public legal relationships",,,,,,,,19909233,,,"English","Middle East J.

We describe its non-Lie algebra of symmetries. By perturbing the homogeneous magnetic field, we discover that, for special directions of the perturbation, a secondary hyperbolic resonance appears in the trap. For corresponding secondary resonance algebra, we describe its non-Lie permutation relations and irreducible representations realized by ordinary differential operators. Under an additional (Ioffe) inhomogeneous perturbation of the magnetic field, we derive an effective Hamiltonian over the secondary symmetry algebra. In an irreducible representation, this Hamiltonian is a model second-order differential operator. The spectral asymptotics is derived, and an integral formula for the asymptotic eigenstates of the entire perturbed trap Hamiltonian is obtained via coherent states of the secondary symmetry algebra. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,,,,,,,10619208,,,"English","Russ.

In particular, R-symmetric and R-skew-symmetric algebras of a linear space V equipped with a skew-invertible Hecke symmetry R are braided algebras. We prove the ""mountain property"" for the numerators and denominators of their Poincaré-Hilbert series (which are always rational functions). Also, we further develop a differential calculus on modified Reflection Equation algebras. Thus, we exhibit a new form of the Leibniz rule for partial derivatives on such algebras related to involutive symmetries R. In particular, we present this rule for the algebra U(gl(m)). The case of the algebra U(gl(2)) and its compact form U(u(2)) (which can be treated as a deformation of the Minkowski space algebra) is considered in detail. On the algebra U(u(2)) we introduce the notion of the quantum radius, which is a deformation of the usual radius, and compute the action of rotationally invariant operators and in particular of the Laplace operator. This enables us to define analogs of the Laplace-Beltrami operators corresponding to certain Schwarzschild-type metrics and to compute their actions on the algebra U(u(2)) and its central extension. Some ""physical"" consequences of our considerations are presented. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Braiding; Hecke symmetry; Laplace-Beltrami operator; Quantum radius; Reflection Equation algebra; Schwarzschild metric","Braiding; Central extensions; Invariant operators; Laplace-Beltrami operator; Non-commutative geometry; Partial derivatives; Quantum radius; Schwarzschild; Deformation; Differentiation (calculus); Geometry; Gravitation; Laplace transforms; Algebra",,,,,,,01968858,,,"English","Adv.

Earth-based telescopes have found smaller harmless objects, such as 2008 TC3, a 4 m-asteroid that was discovered 20h before it exploded over northeastern Sudan (Jenniskens, 2009). 2008 TC3 remains the only asteroid discovered before it hit Earth because it approached Earth from the night side, where it was observed by large telescopes searching for near-Earth objects (NEO's). The larger object that exploded over Chelyabinsk approached Earth from the day side, from too close to the Sun to be detected from Earth. A sizeable telescope in an orbit about the Sun-Earth L1 (SE-L1) libration point could find objects like the ""Chelyabinsk"" asteroid approaching approximately from the line of sight to the Sun about a day before Earth closest approach. Such a system would have the astrometric accuracy needed to determine the time and impact zone for a NEO on a collision course. This would give at least several hours, and usually 2-4 days, to take protective measures, rather than the approximately two-minute interval between the flash and shock wave arrival that occurred in Chelyabinsk. A perhaps even more important reason for providing warning of these events, even smaller harmless ones that explode high in the atmosphere with the force of an atomic bomb, is to prevent mistaking such an event for a nuclear attack that could trigger a devastating nuclear war. A concept using a space telescope similar to that needed for an SE-L1 monitoring satellite, is already conceived by the B612 Foundation, whose planned Sentinel Space Telescope could find nearly all 140 m and larger NEO's, including those in orbits mostly inside the Earth's orbit that are hard to find with Earth-based telescopes, from a Venus-like orbit (Lu, 2013). Few modifications would be needed to the Sentinel Space Telescope to operate in a SE-L1 orbit, 0.01 AU from Earth towards the Sun, to find most asteroids larger than about 5 meters that approach the Earth from the solar direction. The spacecraft would scan 165 square degrees of the sky around the Earth every hour, finding asteroids when they are brightest (small phase angle) as they approach Earth. We will undertake Monte Carlo studies to see what fraction of asteroids 5 m and larger approaching from the Sun might be found by such a mission, and how much warning time might typically be expected. Also, we will check the overall coverage for all Earth-approaching NEO's, including ground-based observations and observations by the recently-launched NEOSSat, which may best fill any gaps in coverage between that provided by an SE-L1 telescope and ground-based surveys. Many of the objects as large as 50 m, like the one that created Meteor Crater in Arizona, will not be found by current NEO surveys, while they would usually be seen by this possible mission even if they approached from the direction of the Sun.

We posit that cross-country differences in egalitarianism-a cultural orientation manifested in intolerance for abuses of market and political power and support for protection of less powerful actors-affect multinational firms' choices of destinations for foreign direct investment (FDI). Using historically motivated instrumental variables, we observe that egalitarianism distance has a negative causal impact on FDI flows. This effect is robust to a broad set of competing accounts, including the effects of other cultural dimensions, various features of the prevailing legal and regulatory regimes, other features of the institutional environment, economic development, and time-invariant unobserved characteristics of origin and host countries. We further show that egalitarianism correlates in a conceptually compatible way with an array of organizational practices pertinent to firms' interactions with nonfinancial stakeholders, such that national differences in these egalitarianism-related features may affect firms' international expansion decisions. © 2013 INFORMS.","Cultural distance; Culture; Egalitarianism; Entrepreneurship; Foreign direct investment (FDI); Global strategy; Multinational firm; Neoinstitutionalism; Pollution haven hypothesis; Regulatory arbitrage",,,,,,,,10477039,,,"English","Organ.

In order to be useful for policy deliberations, the measures of life satisfaction must be psychometrically sound. The reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change of life satisfaction measures are reviewed. The scales are stable under unchanging conditions, but are sensitive to changes in circumstances in people's lives. Several types of data indicate that the scales validly reflect the quality of respondents' lives: (1) Differences between nations in life satisfaction associated with differences in objective conditions, (2) Differences between groups who live in different circumstances, (3) Correlations with nonself-report measures of life satisfaction, (4) Genetic and physiological associations with life satisfaction, (5) Systematic patterns of change in the scales before, during, and after significant life events, and (6) Prediction by life satisfaction scores of future behaviors such as suicide. The life satisfaction scales can be influenced by factors such as question order, current mood, and mode of presentation, but in most cases these can be controlled. Our model of life satisfaction judgments points to the importance of attention, values, standards, and top-down effects. Although the scales are useful in research on individual well-being, there are policy questions that need more analysis and research, such as which types of subjective well-being measures are most relevant to which types of policies, how standards influence scores, and how best to associate the scores with current policy deliberations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Global evaluations; Life satisfaction; Measurement; National policy; Quality of life; Reliability; Validity","behavioral response; policy approach; quality of life; socioeconomic indicator; theoretical study",,,,,,,03038300,,,"English","Soc.

The method relies on the use of small asteroids (asteroid-projectiles) directed at hazardous celestial bodies by giving the projectile a sufficiently small velocity impulse ensuring the Earth gravity assist. As a result, the asteroid-projectile vector can be controllably changed over a wide range. Apophis is considered as an example of the target asteroid. The technical feasibility of this method is discussed. It is noted that despite the potential use of this elegant method, its practical implementation requires further research and development. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,,,,,,,00380946,,,"English","Sol.

A resulting fall of large amount of rocks (several millions m3) into the sea (or a subaerial landslide of an equal volume) may generate a local tsunami that will endanger the adjacent seaside resort Cassis. The propagation of waves, created by this hypothetic event, is simulated using the fully non-linear Boussinesq wave model FUNWAVE. The maximum elevation in Cassis may reach 3.6 m and it only weakly depends on the particular scenario of the collapse. The largest source of danger is the short arrival time (3-3.5 min) of the first wave that is also the highest one.

In the present article, these problems are considered in application to the edge version of the colorability problem. It turns out that each boundary class for the edge 3-colorability problem is a boundary class for the chromatic index problem; however, for each k > 3, there exist uncountably many boundary classes for the edge k-colorability problem each of which is not a boundary class for the chromatic index problem.We formulate some necessary condition for the existence of boundary classes of graphs for the vertex 3-colorability problem which are not boundary for the chromatic index problem.

The first variant is a purely morphological classification based on the choice of person cross-referencing prefixes. The second one is a derivational classification which builds on the morphological mechanisms of reciprocalization and reflexivization. The main research question which lies behind my study is whether verbs derived by means of a derivational marker, for instance, a possibilitive one, behave in the course of other valencychanging operations differently from nonderived verbs. I will show that verb classification in Adyghe has some typologically peculiar properties, the main one being that the derivational classification distinguishes more specific classes than the purely morphological one. In other words, the fact that a verb is derived and how it is derived is crucial for its behavior. The language-specific properties of Adyghe are also typologically relevant. They show that derived verbs and derivational mechanisms are of particular relevance in verb classification and should be given more attention in linguistic work on verb classification than is currently done. © Elsevier BV 2013.","Adyghe; Caucasian languages; Derived verbs; Predictability; Reciprocal; Reflexive; Transitivity; Verb classes",,,,,,,,00243949,,,"English","Linguistics",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881658254

The second prerequisite is a successful integration of Heidegger's ideas to the nature of art into the contemporary discussions around the notion of the aesthetic, its changing boundaries and functions. The article focuses on epistemological, spatial, and material aspects of Heidegger's conception of art, which are especially of interest in the context of contemporary aesthetic theory, whose sphere of competence ranges from the region of art to the variety of aesthetic experiences in everyday life.","Aesthetic experience; Heidegger art; Mediality",,,,,,,,13183362,,,"German","Phainomena",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891881156

After the failed experiment with private financial intermediation in the 1990s, Russia migrated towards a banking system consisting of three-rather than two-tiers and featuring core institutions controlled by the state directly or indirectly. This evolution is consistent with this country's historical pattern of financial intermediation. It is also in line with recent trends in the real sector of the economy, where public ownership has rebounded over the past decade. The core state-controlled banks have evolved into hybrid institutions, performing two various sets of functions: those of regular commercial banks and of policy banks. We found a similar evolution in China, but not in the transitional economies of central Europe.

For the case of pairwise similarity the connection of this measure with the sign correlation of Fechner is noted. The properties of the proposed measure of pairwise similarity in comparison with the classic Pearson correlation are studied. The simple measure of pairwise similarity is applied (in parallel with the classic correlation) for the study of Russian and Swedish market graphs. The new measure of similarity for more than two random variables is introduced and applied to the additional deeper analysis of Russian and Swedish markets.

Based on the findings of a manufacturing industry survey, the evidence suggests that all manufacturing firms were affected by the crisis and that there is no single and dominant transmission channel. Crisis reactions were significantly related to participation in international markets, although participation in trade, in external borrowing or FDI cannot explain recession by themselves. The reversal of growth was mainly caused by demand shock and, following that, by financial constraints. Thus the hypothesis that blames overheating of internal demand in the years prior to the crisis seems to receive statistical backing. Globalised companies, though hit by external shocks, were better prepared to pay the cost and balance the consequences of the crisis. © 2013 Copyright University of Glasgow.",,"crisis management; financial crisis; globalization; industrial development; industrial performance; manufacturing; Russian Federation",,,,,,,09668136,,,"English","Eur.

However, it is unclear how the different value theories relate to each other. This study makes a first step toward a systematic comparison of value theories. It focuses on the individual level of the two approaches that are, at present, probably the most prominent in international research - the theory of basic human values of Shalom Schwartz and the postmodernization theory of Ronald Inglehart. Using data from the World Value Survey and the European Social Survey for West Germany we assess both the internal and the external validity of the two accounts. The results indicate that both value theories have different strengths and weaknesses. Whereas the Inglehart account has lower internal and weaker construct validity, the Schwartz account is somewhat less consistent in its predications. Nevertheless, both value conceptions are able to explain a substantial share of variation in specific attitudes and behavior. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Confirmatory factor analysis; European Social Survey (ESS); Inglehart; Schwartz; Theory comparison; World Value Survey (WVS)",,,,,,,,0049089X,,SSREB,"English","Soc.

Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is an important research area within computational linguistics. Opinion words, which form an opinion lexicon, describe the attitude of the author towards certain opinion targets, i.e., entities and their attributes on which opinions have been expressed. Hence, the availability of a representative opinion lexicon can facilitate the extraction of opinions from texts. For this reason, opinion word mining is one of the key issues in sentiment analysis. We designed and implemented several methods for extracting opinion words. We evaluated these approaches by testing how well the resulting opinion lexicons help improve the accuracy of methods for determining the polarity of the reviews if the extracted opinion words are used as features. We used several machine learning methods: SVM, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and KNN. By using the extracted opinion words as features we were able to improve over the baselines in some cases. Our experiments showed that, although opinion words are useful for polarity detection, they are not sufficient on their own and should be used only in combination with other features. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Sentiment Analysis","Domain specific; Key Issues; Logistic regressions; Machine learning methods; NAtural language processing; Opinion mining; Opinion targets; Sentiment analysis; Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Logistics; Natural language processing systems; Data mining",,,"11th Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, MICAI 2012","27 October 2012 through 4 November 2012","San Luis Potosi",96362,03029743,9783642377976,,"English","Lect.

Owing to the implementation of the methodology it became possible to analyze the current state, the structure, the capacity and development perspectives of the Russian market of Information Technologies. The urgency of the topic under study is determined by instability, by the ambiguity of external conditions which can directly affect the development of business entities in the market conditions. Such a situation enables the necessity in the methodology for evaluation and forecasting of possible changes of market environment based on scientifically grounded methods. The methodologies introduced in the article can be of great interest not only for the specialists in this sphere of knowledge but they can attract the attention of many organizations operating in the market of information technologies, as precise information about the volumes and the structure of the Russian market (or any other developing market) of information technologies is of significant importance for successful business, yet it has been rather a complicated process to get it, alongside with the level of reliability which remains low due to the inaccessibility and non-transparency of the Russian economy.

This method generalizes the NPV method by using two discount rates: the finance rate for positive present values and the reinvestment rate for negative present values. As a result, the different rates discount cash flows invested in the project and released by the project. The GNPV method allows us to consider any nonconventional project as an investment or a loan. Therefore, each nonconventional project always has two rates of return; that is, GIRR(p) and GERR(r), depending on the reinvestment and the finance rate, respectively. The GNPV, generalized internal rate of return (GIRR), and generalized external rate of return (GERR) rules for justifying and ranking independent nonconventional projects are proposed. These rules do not contradict each other. A graphical interpretation (GNPV diagram) of the decision-making rules is suggested.

The relevance of Europe and of the perception of belonging to Europe for Russian national identity is evaluated. To what extent do the Russians see themselves as European and what criteria fit this notion today after the two post-Soviet decades have drawn to a close? The existing image of the EU is analysed in the context of asserting and consolidating the Russian political nation. Elite and expert group opinions are considered, having in mind their influence on the wider public views on national identity. Historic notions of the West in Russian intellectual discourse are evocated as a valid context for the current debate, and the relevance of the traditional cleavage between westernizers and traditionalists for present day identity politics is evaluated. An important point in this discussion is the Russian and the Western perception of the 'values gap'. The paper draws upon three groups of sources: public opinion survey data, public political discourse and its media coverage, and academic and expert literature. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","'values gap'; cultural and ideological cleavages; European identity; identity politics; intellectual discourse; National identity; political nation; public attitudes; the significant 'Other'",,,,,,,,15705854,,,"English","Perspect.

First, we test the relative importance of structural and actor-oriented factors using a specially constructed index of democracy. Cross-country regression analysis reveals that policy-related variables have higher statistical explanatory power: presidentialism vs. parliamentarism; opposition coming to power in the first founding elections; foreign policy orientation towards the West and state capture as the most significant variables. These findings are further corroborated and expanded by qualitative analysis. Following this we examine types of post-communist stateness as another possible explanation of differences in regime transformation results. We propose a vector measure of stateness which is based on both statistical data and expert evaluations. This measure allows us to develop a typology of stateness in post-communist countries which is used to assess the relationship between regime and stateness dynamics. We find that those post-communist states which fulfil a broad range of social functions are more successful in their democratic development. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","democratization; dynamics modelling; post-communist countries; regime transformations; Stateness",,,,,,,,15705854,,,"English","Perspect.

Model parameters of the material were chosen to fit a typical polar organic photoconductor polycarbonate doped with 30 of aromatic hydrazone, whose transport properties are well documented in literature. Simulated carrier mobility demonstrates a usual Poole-Frenkel field dependence and its slope is very close to the experimental value without using any adjustable parameter. At room temperature transients are universal with respect to the electric field and transport layer thickness. At the same time, carrier mobility does not depend on the layer thickness and transients develop a well-defined plateau where the current does not depend on time, thus demonstrating a non-dispersive transport regime. Tails of the transients decay as power law with the exponent close to -2. This particular feature indicates that transients are close to the boundary between dispersive and non-dispersive transport regimes. Shapes of the simulated transients are in very good agreement with the experimental ones. In summary, we provide a first verification of a self-consistency of the dipolar glass transport model, where major transport parameters, extracted from the experimental transport data, are then used in the transport simulation, and the resulting mobility field dependence and transients are in very good agreement with the initial experimental data. © 2013 American Institute of Physics.",,"Adjustable parameters; Experimental datum; Experimental values; Monte Carlo simulations; Organic photoconductors; Simulated transients; Transport parameters; Transport simulation; Carrier mobility; Electric fields; Glass; Monte Carlo methods; Polycarbonates; Transients; Transport properties; Power quality",,,,,,,00219606,,JCPSA,"English","J Chem Phys",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875149797

The concept of the number of degrees of freedom, which relates the observable quantities listed above, is generalized to the case of low temperatures. An analogy between the creation and annihilation operators for pairs (dimers) and the creation and annihilation operators for particles (molecules) is carried out. A generalization of the concept of a Bose condensate is introduced for classical molecules as an analog of an ideal liquid (without attraction). The negative pressure in the liquid is treated as holes (of exciton type) in the density of the Bose condensate. The phase transition gas-liquid is calculated for an ideal gas (without attraction). A comparison with experimental data is carried out. In the other part of the paper, we introduce the concept of new observable quantity, namely, of a pair (a dimer), as a result of attraction between nearest neighbors. We treat in a new way the concepts of Boyle temperature TB(as the temperature above which the dimers disappear) and of the critical temperature Tc(below which the trimers and clusters are formed). The equation for the Zeno line is interpreted as the relation describing the dependence of the temperature on the density at which the dimers disappear. We calculate the maximal density of the liquid and also the maximal density of the holes. The law of corresponding states is derived as a result of an observation by a macrodevice which cannot distinguish between molecules of distinct gases, and a comparison of theoretical and experimental data is carried out. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,,,,,,,10619208,,,"English","Russ.

It charts the trajectory of academic writing on East European youth cultures and suggests the region's state socialist past (which made social inequalities relatively insignificant at a time when, elsewhere, youth cultural studies were dominated by class-based readings) combined with the explosion of inequality in the post-socialist period (by which time class-resistant post-subcultural theories led anglophone academic discussion), makes it an interesting vantage point from which to reconsider academic paradigms. Drawing on empirical examples of youth cultural practice in (post)-socialist Eastern Europe, it argues for a perspective that integrates structural and cultural factors shaping young people's lives. It suggests moving forward western theoretical debates - often stymied in arguments over nomenclature ('subculture', 'postsubculture', 'neo-tribe') - by shifting the focus of study from 'form' ('subculture' etc.) to 'substance' (concrete cultural practices) and attending to everyday communicative, musical, sporting, educational, informal economy, and territorial practices. Since such practices are embedded in the 'whole' rather than 'subcultural' lives of young people, this renders visible how cultural practices are enabled and constrained by the same social divisions and inequalities that structure society at large. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,,17519020,,,"English","Sociol.

This approach to reasoning is implemented as a logic program in a natural language multiagent mental simulator NL-MAMS, which yields the totality of possible mental states few steps in advance, given an arbitrary initial mental state of participating agents. Due to an extensive vocabulary of formally represented mental attitudes, communicative actions and accumulated library of behaviors, NL-MAMS is capable of yielding much richer set of sequences of mental state than a conventional system of reasoning about beliefs, desires and intentions would deliver. Also, NL-MAMS functions in domain-independent manner, outperforming machine learning-based systems for predicting behaviors of human agents in broad domains where training sets are limited. We evaluate the correctness, coverage and maximum complexity of the NL-MAMS and discuss its integration with other reasoning components and its application domains. The proposed component is intended to be integrated into eBay human behavior simulation system, predicting behavior of buyers and sellers in normal and conflict situations. Also, NL-MAMS can be a part of any software system where modeling of human users is necessary, such as a personalized assistant, a tutoring or decision support system, advisor, recommender and conflict resolver. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

If the time frame (past, present, future) is set by a temporal adverb, the verb inflection should correspond (yesterday he walk. ed; today he walk. s). Temporal violations by simple verbs (single, lexical verbs inflected with tense) in the present tense and with present time reference elicit a P600 effect (Baggio, 2008; Dragoy, Stowe, Bos, & Bastiaanse, 2012). However tense does not always coincide with time reference; in languages such as Dutch and English, reference to the past can be established by using the present tense in the present perfect (e.g. 'he has eaten the cake'). The current study investigates whether the P600 effects described by Dragoy et al. and Baggio are caused by tense or time reference violations of the verb. In the context of a past adverb, ERP responses to auxiliaries in present tense with either congruent past time reference or incongruent non-past time reference were compared. The findings show that the P600 effect for violations of the temporal context is caused by the time reference of the complete verb form, rather than by the tense. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Auxiliary; Discourse linking; ERP; P600; Periphrastic verbs; Tense; Time reference","adult; article; brain depth recording; controlled study; event related potential; female; human; human experiment; linguistics; male; nerve conduction; normal human; priority journal; response time; thinking; time perception",,,,,,,09116044,,JONEE,"English","J.

Methods: Cross-sectional and annual time-series data from 1870 to 1894, 2008 and 2009 on the mortality rate from deaths due to 'drunkenness' were compared for men in the 50 provinces of tsarist 'European Russia': an area that today corresponds with the territory occupied by the Baltic countries, Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine and the Russian provinces to the west of the Ural Mountains. Results: In 1870-1894, the male death rate from 'drunkenness' in the Russian provinces (15.9 per 100,000) was much higher than in the non-Russian provinces. However, the rate recorded in Russia in the contemporary period was even higher-23.3. Conclusions: Russia has had high levels of alcohol mortality from at least the late 19th century onwards. While a dangerous drinking pattern and spirits consumption may underpin high alcohol mortality across time, the seemingly much higher levels in the contemporary period seem to be also driven by an unprecedented level of consumption, and also possibly, surrogate alcohol use. This study highlights the urgent need to reduce the level of alcohol consumption among the population in order to reduce high levels of alcohol mortality in contemporary Russia. © The Author 2013.

Whilst the community has grown since the first edition of the International Seville Conference on Future-oriented Technology Analysis (FTA), there is still little dialogue and exchange between those applying quantitative and those applying qualitative methods. The FTA events have, since the beginning, provided an avenue to debate methodological aspects and this paper summarises and furthers the discussion developed during the 2011 edition, building on the debates at the conference and between members of the conference Scientific Committee, to which the authors of this paper belong. In particular this paper describes the methodological state of the field through a tripartite taxonomy of increasing levels of qualitative and quantitative integration. It shows how significant progress has been made for simpler forms of combinations but not for more sophisticated (and perhaps more promising) ones. Following that, it suggests that an epistemological divide, common to the social sciences as a whole, combined with cultural differences and misconceptions within the FTA community are amongst the factors undermining further methodological integration. The paper concludes by suggesting some steps, combining research and practice, to overcome such barriers. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Barriers; Combination; Epistemological divide; FTA; Integration; Qualitative; Quantitative","Barriers; Combination; Epistemological divide; FTA; Qualitative; Quantitative; Innovation; Technological forecasting; Integration; conference proceeding; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; technological development",,,,,,,00401625,,,"English","Technol.

Such a form of intervention can increase efficiency in the private market, and our design of disaster insurance suggests a prominent role of catastrophe reinsurance. The model predicts buyers will increase their demand in the private market, and the seller will lower prices to such an extent that their revenues decrease upon introduction of disaster insurance. We test two predictions in the context of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA). It is already known that the introduction of TRIA led to negative abnormal returns in the insurance industry. In addition, we show this negative effect is stronger for larger and for low-risk-averse firms-two results that are consistent with our model. The seller's risk aversion plays an important role in quantifying such feedback effects, and we point toward possible distortions in which a firm may even be overhedged upon introduction of disaster insurance. © The Journal of Risk and Insurance, 2012.",,,,,,,,,00224367,,,"English","J.

It does so by critically reflecting on the selected papers for this special issue as well as on the discussions that took place at the fourth Seville International Conference on Future-oriented Technology Analysis. Considering the potential roles of FTA in enabling a better understanding of complex situations and in defining effective policy responses leads to the understanding that appropriate FTA practices are needed to enable FTA to fulfil such roles. Dealing with disruptive changes - and grand challenges in particular -, therefore, raises several conceptual, methodological and operational issues. Two of them are general, while further two are specific to the so-called grand challenges: i) distinguish known unknowns, unknown knows and unknown unknowns, ii) combine quantitative and qualitative approaches in a relevant and feasible way, iii) understand the complex and systemic nature of grand challenges, and iv) orchestrate joint responses to grand challenges. After a brief explanation of these issues, the paper outlines the main ideas of the papers published in this special issue. These present various methodological aspects of FTA approaches as well as some advances needed in practice to assist FTA practitioners and stakeholders in comprehending transformations and in tackling the so-called grand challenges. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","FTA practices; Fundamental change and transformations; Grand challenges","Decision makers; FTA practices; Fundamental changes; Grand Challenge; Joint response; Methodological aspects; Operational issues; Qualitative approach; Seville; Technology analysis; Technological forecasting; Innovation; conceptual framework; decision making; methodology; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; stakeholder; technological change",,,,,,,00401625,,,"English","Technol.

It is shown that the modern stage of development in advanced economies could be described by the post-industrial phase with (a) the specific proportions in the occupational structure (predominance of professional managers and technical experts); (b) particular nature of work and the corresponding extent of labor division according to specialization and qualification (highly skilled labor with broad specialization and a new criterion of creativity included within qualifications). Within the certain historical framework these indicators, combined onto the entire scheme, produce the criteria to distinct different types of socio-economic development and arrange them in consistent order. The analysis of occupational structure of Russian population shows that the reforms of 1990s have facilitated the process of deindustrialization alongside with the growth of semi- and low-skilled jobs. According to the scheme, Russia seems to have reached the stage of the development that is similar to one of the 1950-1960s in the USA and the Europe. © 2013 CEEUN.","Industrialization; Knowledge based economy; Labour potential; Modernization; Occupational structure; Russia; Socio-economic development",,,,,,,,16144007,,,"English","Transit.

Survey data were collected from 500 managers of retail chains and their suppliers in five Russian cities. The sample includes firms of different sizes that sell food and home electronic appliances. After the diffusion of new contract arrangements is examined, logistic regression models are constructed to evaluate major sources of relational conflicts. The findings indicate that power-advantaged firms disseminate new rules of exchange effectively. However, relational conflicts largely originate not from these new demands but from the frequent contract infringements by both exchange parties. The study is confined to two sectors of retail trade in one country. Further research is required to determine the effects on channel relationships of the financial crisis and of the adoption of restrictive federal legislation. Practitioners should recognise the need to provide socio-political legitimacy for the new rules of exchange. Otherwise, they may face relational conflicts and provoke restrictive state regulations. Public officials should know that relational conflicts may originate largely from opportunistic behaviour by exchange parties rather than from abuse of market power. This paper presents the first systematic quantitative study of retailer-supplier relationships in Russia. It investigates institutional change and relational conflicts as perceived by both exchange parties. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Ideal-typical trials are called explanatory trials to distinguish it from trials completed under real-world conditions. The four most prevalent types of bias (selection-, performance-, attrition-, and detection-bias) can be avoided and internal validity of a study can be increased if all requested quality criteria will be met. The external validity can be neither investigated not can it be confirmed by randomized trials. But the confirmation of external validity is as important as the confirmation of internal validity because knowledge that has been generated in RCTs will be valuable only if it can be successfully applied to patients under real-world conditions. For confirmation of external validity the mentioned four types of bias have to be avoided. In addition, it has to be confirmed that the individuals from whom the evidence was derived are comparable to the individuals to whom the evidence should be applied. Violation of this simple appearing requirement is called 'sampling bias'. A two-step procedure seems to be useful to confirm internal as well as external evidence. As first step the efficacy of a therapeutic principle may be confirmed under ideal study conditions by using an explanatory trial without demanding the confirmation of external validity. In a second step the benefit for the investigated group of patients is examined under real-world conditions (pragmatic trial). The design and established methods for evaluation of these studies are discussed. The two-step approach offers three advantages: it reduces the risk to over-interpret the results of RCTs as explanatory trials can only demonstrate efficacy under ideal conditions.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper integrates the concepts of network relationships, value chain management, and customer lifetime value (CLV). The authors use participative inquiry and case studies to validate and clarify the model. Findings: The authors develop the customer flow conceptual model and propose a sequence of actions to translate it into measures and indicators that will allow firms to understand their role in the creation of sustainable value. Using this model, the authors conduct comparative analyses of the acquisition and retention strategies of a multinational firm in the European and Russian markets. The results provide a crucial justification for new directions in future long-term marketing activities. Research limitations/implications: The model is validated in two cases in different industries. Further research is required to examine the implementation of suggested tools in different industries. Practical implications: The model was simplified for a practical application and indicators for future monitoring process and customer flow management were developed. Originality/value: The authors developed the concept of customer flow to assess the long-term results of marketing activities and to emphasize the difference between managing new and existing customers. New performance metrics are proposed based on customer flow and its structural characteristics. This allowed comparing of acquisition and retention strategies of the same company in different markets and reveals the crucial differences between the marketing strategies prevailing in Russia and those in Europe.

Because these classical readings of Hobbes still inform most social theory, sociologists are in effect trapped within them. Through a careful analysis of classic interpretations of Hobbes by Tönnies and Parsons, coupled with a close reading of Hobbes' actual texts, and his criticisms of Aristotle, this paper will suggest that a different understanding of the 'people' who populate Hobbes' social universe is possible. It will be suggested that this new understanding of Hobbes also makes the contemporary understanding of the history of political philosophy more fruitful for theoretical sociology. © The Author(s) 2013.","Individualism; parsons; prudence; social order; state; Tönnies; utilitarianism; war",,,,,,,,1468795X,,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach: The previous research in customer portfolio theory is reviewed, with special attention to customer interconnectedness. Customer interconnectedness as a criterion to build customer portfolios is studied in the example of large Russian b2b company. First, the results of participative inquiry research within the company are presented and then the insights from five in-depth interviews are described. Findings: Findings suggest that the assumption of customer independence in a portfolio, on which most of customer portfolio models are based, may not fit certain markets and industries. This paper sheds light on to the specifics of customer portfolio building, in the Russian context and results in the customer interconnectedness assumption. Research limitations/implications: Additional research beyond the provided exploratory study is needed to quantitatively test the assumption and generalize the results. The main research implications relate to the new perspective on customer portfolio theory based on customer interconnectedness. Practical implications: The paper provides researchers and practitioners with insights into customer portfolio models specifics existing in Russia. This knowledge can be helpful, also, for foreign companies entering the Russian market.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on statistical analysis and the results of a pilot survey of 192 local businessmen, followed by imitation modeling analysis, the study tests hypotheses regarding the impact of unsatisfactory institutional environments, including weak property rights protection, on innovation cluster development in Russia. Findings: The analysis shows that the impact of adverse factors on innovation activities of cluster members is crucial, and estimates to what extent the negative factors' influence should be reduced to prevent cluster degradation processes. Research limitations/implications: The models provide a number of sensitivity tests of the parameters; however, data from clusters with different levels of support and protection need to be obtained. Government experiments could be conducted to test the models and find ranges of optimal parameters for cluster development. Short of this, examination of actual data from different cluster in similar environments would allow estimated of optimal strategies for support. Longitudinal data can also help determine the actual cause and effect of successful innovation cluster development.

We apply this new metrics to a survey of manufacturing firms in Russia to identify the economic effects associated with the lack of property protection in a transition economy. Our analysis supports the view that there is a close relationship between institutions, property rights and economic growth. Our findings confirm that redistributive risks provide a depressing effect on investment and innovative activity of manufacturing enterprises and potentially result in a huge loss in efficiency and economic growth, which in other institutional settings could have been avoided. © 2012 Association for Comparative Economic Studies.","Economic growth; Economic institutions; Property rights",,,,,,,,01475967,,,"English","J.

It is revealed that under certain wave excitation frequencies, a significant increase in run-up amplification is observed. It is found that this amplification is due to the excitation of resonant mode in the region between the shoreline and wave maker. Frequency and magnitude of the maximum amplification are in good correlation with the numerical calculation results represented in the paper (Stefanakis et al., 2011).

Accordingly, tax compliance depends on the factors perceived trust in the authorities and perceived power of the authorities, but trust on the one hand fosters voluntary compliance whereas power on the other hand leads to enforced compliance. The present study tested these main assumptions of the slippery slope framework in four European countries differing in terms of cultural and economic settings (Austria, Hungary, Romania and Russia) by presenting participants with different scenarios of trust and power. As predicted, the highest level of intended tax compliance and the lowest level of tax evasion were found in conditions of high trust and high power. In addition, participants in conditions of high trust indicate more voluntary compliance just as participants in conditions of high power indicate higher enforced compliance. The present results support the assumptions of the slippery slope framework and confirm the role of trust and power as important determinants of tax compliance. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Cross-cultural; Power; Slippery slope framework; Tax compliance; Trust",,,,,,,,01674870,,,"English","J.

This approach is based on distinguishing among semantic domains which can be said to occur across languages and which are useful and relevant from a typological perspective. We illustrate this approach by exploring the conceptualization of motion / being in liquid medium (aquamotion), within which four general domains (swimming, sailing, drifting, and floating) are recognized. Using this distinction, we propose a typology of aquamotion systems that distinguishes between 'rich', 'poor', and 'middle' systems of aquamotion expressions depending on the lexical contrasts that the language displays. © editorial matter and organization Mila Vulchanova and Emile van der Zee 2013.

In this model, the sequential intervals between neighboring monomers along a chain are considered as quenched random variables, and energies of nonlocal bonds are assumed to be concave functions of those intervals. A few factors are neglected: the contribution of loop factors to the partition function, the variation in energies of different types of complementary nucleotides, the stacking interactions, and constraints on the minimal size of loops. However, the model captures well the formation of folded structures without pseudoknots in an arbitrary sequence of nucleotides. Using the optimization procedure for a special class of concave-type potentials, borrowed from optimal transport analysis, we derive the local difference equation for the ground state free energy of the chain with the planar (RNA-like) architecture of paired links. We consider various distribution functions of intervals between neighboring monomers (truncated Gaussian and scale free) and demonstrate the existence of a topological crossover from sequential to essentially nested configurations of paired links. © 2013 American Physical Society.",,"Complementary nucleotides; Concave function; Folded structures; Gaussians; Heteropolymer chain; Nonlocal; Optimal transport; Optimization procedures; Partition functions; Planar diagrams; Pseudo-knots; RNA molecules; Scale-free; Secondary structures; Special class; Stacking interaction; Toy models; Difference equations; Monomers; Nucleotides; RNA; Optimization; RNA; article; chemical model; chemical structure; chemistry; computer simulation; conformation; statistical model; ultrastructure; Computer Simulation; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Models, Statistical; Nucleic Acid Conformation; RNA",,,,,,,15393755,,PLEEE,"English","Phys.

The notion of «real structure» integrates formalized and non-formalized professional relationships in an educational institution. Statement of this problem is connected to the pressing topic of the teacher's professional loneliness, that is to a low level of institutions' social capital. The professional loneliness of teachers results in the situation when the most urgent task of educators' professional development, of human capital formation is mostly fulfilled at the expense of external resources (training in external organizations). But there are problems here in terms of both financial restrictions and poor professional development system performance. Internal resources of the educational institution (observation of other professional practices, reflection, peer tuition) are hard to access because of a low level of social capital and often do not constitute the focus of attention for heads of schools. The author considers not only reasons for the institutions' real structure study, but also a toolkit which enables to appraise workplace stable relationships in the institution, their configurations and other characteristics of network structures. The study uses both traditional socio-demographic characteristics and network analysis elements. The author makes the assumption that the institution's real structure is simple (has a low level of complexity), considers it to be a social network and thinks that this simplicity can be a critical deterrent to development of a certain institution. Then complication of real structures is an important resource in terms of improving effectiveness of training and education and contributes to growth of social and consequently human capital at school. A pilot phase, carried out on the basis of five Russian schools in different regions, revealed that real interaction structures are indeed characterized by a low level of complexity, one-way relationships are prevalent in school communities, a percentage of reciprocal relationships is insignificant, a dyad constitutes a typical configuration of reciprocal relationships, a number of triads is greatly limited. During 2013-2014 the author expects to involve a considerable number of general education institutions which will make it possible to identify common problems of real structures in the secondary level education system on the whole.","Human capital; Professional capital; Professional development; Professional loneliness; Social capital; Social networks; Teachers; Workplace relationships",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

A two-step cluster analysis has revealed seven qualitatively differentiated groups of students in Moscow universities. The study compares learning difficulties, attitudes to social life at universities, and distinctive features of goals in life and education in all the seven groups. It has been established that first-year students are primarily differentiated by their family status and by the reasons for choosing their field of study. These factors are responsible for different attitudes towards education and belonging to the university in the first year of studies. Academic performance at school plays a less important role in differentiating between the student groups. The most significant differences between the groups are found in students' confidence about their future careers and in their overall assessments of learning experience. The authors identify types of learning activities where different clusters encounter most difficulties. The paper contains a comparison of how first-year students from different clusters assess the choice of field of study they have made. Each of the clusters is described in detail. Prospects for using the cluster analysis method are specified. Through the example of some student groups, the authors give recommendations on how to create programs oriented at satisfying students' needs and compensating for specific deficiencies. Cluster analysis results may later be used to trace educational trajectories of students from different clusters.","Adaptation in a higher education institution; Cluster analysis; Difficulties in learning; Educational resources; Educational trajectories; First-year students; Higher education; Material resources; Selection of an occupation; Unified state exam",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

In the first part of the article basic definitions are given, and key statistical characteristics of social media are described - such as network density, a network degree, the degree distribution, a walk, a distance, a diameter, a clustering coefficient, centrality. Then two approaches to social media modelling are described and examples of some particular models are given. Models where a network is considered to be a multidimensional dependent variable (random graph exponential models, stochastic actor-oriented models and so on) explain the associations by agents' characteristics and network statistics. Models where networks are independent variables (for example, spatial regression models) explain results of an actor's activity by network properties, results and characteristics of other actors. In the second part of the article a review of empirical studies of students' social media is given. One of key factors that determine initiation of friendly ties between students is proximity of their characteristics. Students strive for interacting with peers who are somehow like themselves: of one ethnic group, with similar social and economic characteristics and interests. A geographic proximity of students' places of residence, their neighbourhood in a hostel also enhance the likelihood of initiation of friendly ties. Another line of research is connected to the analysis of how students' social media influence their academic progress and behaviour in an academic setting. Empirical studies show that a student setting with a high training level - friends, neighbours in the hostel, fellow students - contribute to a better average score of the student. Influence of other students' characteristics, behaviour and academic progress on academic progress of the student is referred to as a co-education effect or a setting effect. There are empirical confirmations that the co-education effect has a stronger influence on students' education process than a social integration, personal achievements or a personal motivation. The student setting influences not only the academic progress but also what courses are selected to study, sports achievements and a general feeling of life satisfaction. Although students' social media are predominantly formed under the influence of endogenous factors, an appropriate university policy can to some extent contribute to development of friendships between students, and their significance is determined by an influence of co-education effects on students' academic progress.","Academic achievements; Co-education effects; Higher education; Social media",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

The possibility of its overcoming in the case of discrete features is explored by synthesizing the novel recognition criterion with the comparison of the histograms of query and model images.

These results reveal that in the pre-revolutionary period the term was set in customs laws. Meanwhile, the author states that the term was used to describe any activity related to secret movement of goods across the customs border or despite them or to describe evasion of taxes and custom duties. The Soviet customs law provided even wider definition of the illegal trafficking term. It also included a list of associated activities. Modern Russian legislation also defined the term differently. Besides, the term is used both in customs and criminal law. Since illegal trafficking in Russia is defined as criminally punishable act in customs law, the author closely studies interrelation between the criminal and customs legisltion relating to illegal trafficking definition.

Overall effects of spending one year in Russian schools turned out to be insignificant. The effects are lower in the countries with early division into general and vocational programs than in the countries where all 15-year-old students take general education programs only. Moreover, effects of spending one year in schools with general education only are found to be large in all countries. Vocational students have lower academic progress as compared to students in schools with general education trajectories. The relationship between socioeconomic status and efficiency of school education, as well as the extent and power of this relationship, depend a lot on the educational system and vary widely from country to country.

Participants searched for an odd-colored target among distractors of one, two, or three other colors. An enduring advantage of large over small sets (i.e., negative slopes of search functions) was found, and this advantage grew with the number of colored subsets among distractors. The results of Experiments 1 and 2 showed that the negative slopes cannot be ascribed to the spatial grouping between distractors but can be partially explained by the spatial density of the visual sets. Hence, it appears that observers relied on numerosity of subsets to guide attention. Experiments 3a and 3b tested the processes within and between color subsets of distractors more precisely. It was found that the visual system collects numerosity statistics that can be used for guidance within each subset independently. However, each subset representation should be serially selected by attention. As attention shifts from one subset to another, the ""statistical power"" effects from every single subset are accumulated to provide a more pronounced negative slope.","attention; ensemble representation; feature search; numerosity; visual search","attention; color vision; female; human; male; pattern recognition; physiology; reaction time; statistical distribution; Attention; Color Perception; Female; Humans; Male; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Reaction Time; Statistical Distributions",,,,,,,15347362,,,"English","J Vis",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961203995

The model was developed on the basis of the tendency of the conducting carbon nanoparticles to aggregate into electric dipoles preserving the anomalously large permittivity of the composite. It is shown that the effect depends on the preparation technology. If the melt solidification occurs under ultrasound vibrations the effect decreases by a factor of 3.

The latter is characterized by a specific stratification based on socioeconomic status of families and differing from stratification patterns in foreign schools. The study compares how pro-school and anti-school cultures influence academic performance at various levels of students' social environment (school, class, close friendship groups). As a result of two-stage stratified sampling, the schools involved in the study have been divided into two groups: with standard and advanced educational programs. Multi-stage regression analysis has established that socioeconomic differentiation of Russian schools does not result in polarization of pro-school and anti-school attitudes in different types of schools. The level of pro-school attitudes is rather determined by individual and family factors (gender, immigration status, socioeconomic status of family and parental education). In order to compare how school and immediate environment influence overall academic performance, the authors have built a three-tier model: individual - clique (an intensive interaction group) - school. The clique level was introduced into analysis by building social cliques within classes and identifying intensive interaction groups where internal relations are much closer than relations of members with other students. It has been discovered that factors of pro-school attitude in cliques have a positive influence on academic performance, with due account of individual attitudes and sociodemographic factors. Polarization of attitudes, uncharacteristic of the school level, evolves and consolidates at the level of intense interaction groups.","Cliques; Peer effects; Pro-school/anti-school culture; Social network analysis",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

At least since the late 1930s Savitskii's ""classical"" Eurasianist historiosophical and political ideas developed into a new, explicitly anti-Western and pro-Soviet, yet still anticommunist conceptual framework that can be called ""trans-Eurasianism.""

Within this study fellow students with whom a certain student spends most of his or her time were considered to be his or her friends. An assistant at university is a fellow student whom students ask for help in their studies most of all. Data on a structure of relationships in student groups were collected by means of a questionnaire. In order to analyze a distinction between friendship networks and assistance networks at university, an exponential random graph modeling (ERGM) method was used. The authors show that both networks are characterized by reciprocity of relationships and that in both networks relationships have a tendency to form triads. Probability of a relationship between students depends to a great extent on their belonging to one training group and one sex. Students ask for help and are on friendly terms with those fellow students who have academic achievements of the same level as they do. Academically successful students are popular in the assistance network but not in the friendship network. The received results are analyzed in terms of their meaning for co-education effects. Characteristics of reciprocity of relationships, as well as of their isolation in triads, are important for interpreting the ways the co-education effects can distribute. It looks like the greatest influence on a certain student's achievements his reciprocal friends and assistants can have, and also his immediate environment density. Students studying on a commercial basis are more likely to form friendship networks, while students studying in state-funded places are more likely to form assistance networks. Students of different modes of study seem to build their social relationships in different ways, and so influence of peers on students of different modes of study is different. The authors arrive at a conclusion that in the analysis of co-education effects it is necessary to take into consideration a role different relationships play in distributing these effects, as well as internal features of networks according to which social relationships are built, and also mechanisms of gaining popularity and influence among students.","Assistance networks; Co-education; Friendship networks; Popularity; Social influence; Social networks; Students",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

The author considers reforms of teacher training systems in 12 countries of Asia, Europe and North America which were carried out during last decades of the XXth century: grounds for these reforms, main trends of changes that took place, their nodal elements which in the author's opinion need to be taken into account when planning a teacher training reform in Russia. All actions of reformers come to three main directions: a system of measures aimed at increasing teachers' occupational prestige, a package of measures aimed at retention of teachers in schools and transition to such a design of teacher training educational programmes that would help with performing the first two tasks. The reforms resulted in the following changes: the teacher training system ceased to be departmental, and a base unit (a design unit) is now an educational programme ready for continuous variation, and not a structure which fulfills it. The author discusses such indicators of occupational prestige as teacher wage rates in different countries and a training level of applicants at teacher training higher education institutions. There are systems of measures in many countries which have a good track record and make the occupation look attractive for youth: monthly allowances for pupils in the final year of secondary school under the condition that after graduating from a higher education institution they will work not less than three years at school; a special enrollment procedure for those who apply for teacher educational programmes which includes, along with a centralized testing, interviews - in order to appraise acceptability for the teaching profession - creativity competitions, recommendations are requested; possibility to get a teacher education in dif ferent ways; provision of career oppor tunities. The ar ticle shows that there are no institutional arr angements in Russia which would ensure youth retention in the occupation.

Dismissal of students from Russian higher education institutions has been studied through analyzing the results of questionnaires and interviews conducted among dismissed students. It has been established that Russian higher education system fosters a special type of academic dismissal, which is a coercive procedure performed by universities, or professors, towards students. Academic dismissal in Russia has a qualitative distinction from the dropout phenomenon characteristic of the Western world, when a student leaves a university voluntarily. Most commonly, students drop out because they are poorly integrated into university life; thus, dropouts may be prevented by implementing socialization and orientation programs. Specific features of academic dismissal in Russia require introduction of special dismissal level control principles. It has been discovered that dismissed students are very likely to resume their education (only 4% of respondents give up on higher education), which reveals the need to improve criteria of academic assessment and to develop non-dismissal institutional discipline measures. Exploration of academic dismissal reasons and mechanisms is of practical importance for enhancing efficiency of educational policies in higher education institutions.","Academic culture; Academic dismissal; Education financing; Higher education; Learning efficiency; Student dropout",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Information is given on the level and dynamics of educator salaries in educational institutions of various types as compared to the average inter-industry wage. The paper studies labor strategies and expectations of educators at different levels of the educational system. The study identifies the most widespread educator part-time jobs and the gap between the real income and the income required for educators to focus on their primary activity. Through analyzing educators' evaluation of their salaries in comparison to those of their counterparts, it has been shown that transferring to another educational institution will not increase educators' incomes. As educators evaluate their salaries in comparison to those in other industries, it becomes clear that the existing job contracts in education do not make educators competitive in the labor market. However, very few educators are willing to make a career change. The study describes how executives of professional educational institutions assess professional level of teachers, reveals recruiting and incentive payment criteria, and determines amounts of incentive payments and of the most common benefits. The existing educator salaries are stated to be insufficient for education executives to expect absolute commitment and efficiency from educators and for students to expect high quality of education services.","Educators; Effective contract; Personnel policy; Salaries",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Document management is regarded as an administrative practice allowing the Ministry to inculcate bureaucratic values and an ethos of serving the government in professor, making them renounce their administrative autonomy. Being engaged in bureaucratic re-arrangement of reality, Russian professors very soon embarked on paperwork, which boosted the document flow in universities. The large scale of this behavior model indicates that a new type of university culture was born. Bureaucratic management of universities in the Russian Empire was different from that in Western countries in that it aimed to make the document flow uniform with other public institutions and to develop uniform rules and formal language. As a result, professors gradually lost the opportunity to express their own opinions and to take initiative in communicating with the government. The authors emphasize the subordinate nature of activities performed by professors to satisfy relevant governmental demands, which suggested that professors assisted in opening new schools, controlled existing ones, eradicated prejudice, obtained primary data on imperial regions and resources (topographic, meteorological, ethnographic, and economic data), and disseminated Western scientific ideas and knowledge in regional culture. An analysis of document management in Russian universities of the first half of the 19th century has shown that they were part of the administrative structure at that time, which diminished their status significantly, as compared to Western universities.","Management; Ministry of Education; Paperwork; Records; The Russian Empire; Universities",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

The author proves that difficulties associated with academic writing are caused not only by requirements that are higher in universities than in schools, but also by poor comprehensive reading skills. She claims that indifferent, or shallow, reading and writing in university trace their roots back to school or even pre-school years. Akhapkina determines stages of language personality development, studies the factors that influence the development of reading competencies at each of these stages, and reveals the major killers of interest in reading. Proper development of comprehensive reading skills may be achieved, first of all, by balancing belles-lettres with scientific and educational texts, and balancing duration and frequency of active reading with those of passive listening and watching. The author discusses how comprehensive reading motivation and level of understanding depend on the text selected and on whether it is self-sufficient or not. Markers of an academic text are identified, as they are seen by high school and university students. The most important ones are redundant terminology, complex syntax overload, and conformance to the methodical model. The author describes the major features of student reading and writing experience and reading interests. Mechanisms of typical agrammatic features are revealed; a classification of frequency errors is given, and some methods are proposed to expand stimulus material expansion through correcting academic writing skills gradually.","Academic writing; Agrammatism; Comprehensive reading/writing; Indifferent reading/writing; Lexical and syntactic irregularities; Reading; Self-sufficient text; Writing",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

We do not constrain neither the intermediate nor final resource markings, hence a net can have an infinite number of different reachable states. An initially marked RWF-net is called sound if it properly terminates and, moreover, adding any extra initial resource does not violate its proper termination. An (unmarked) RWF-net is sound if it is sound for some initial resource. In this paper we prove the decidability of both marked and unmarked soundness for a restricted class of RWF-nets with a single unbounded resource place (1-dim RWF-nets).

On the basis of interviews and questionnaires collected in the cities in question the paper examines specificity of understanding of ""twin-cities"" concept and its practical execution in the Asian context. Exploring the extent to which the twin-cities relations model is applicable to Russian-Chinese border cities, the author concludes that cooperation predominantly exists in a form of bilateral annual events in various spheres (culture, education, sport, etc.) and dialog between delegations of region's/city's representatives, not in a form of direct people-to-people or institution-to-institution cooperation. The lack of local initiatives to cooperate (almost zero-amount of initiatives not from region's/city's administrations) is named as a main drawback of Blagoveshchensk and Heihe relations.

In the article personal achievements, educational expectations and grit as a personal trait of high school students were considered as mediators between family educational resources and students' educational career decisions. The research design consisted of two repeated measures of high school students: the first observation was done when respondents were 9th grade students (n = 2000), the second one was carried out two years later on the same sample (n = 1 1 56 due to sample attrition). After graduating from 9th grade survey participants were obliged to make a career choice, they could stay in a higher school for another two years, move to an elementary professional school (2-year education) or continue in a vocational secondary school (3-year education). Path analysis was conducted using Mplus Version 6 software. Results showed that family educational resources and students' expectations are positively related with all three mediators. It was revealed that there is no direct effect of family educational resources on young men educational choices. Family resources influence on adolescents' career are fully mediated by students' educational achievements and expectations. In other words self-efficacy and educational expectations can considerably change family resources effect. Grit as a personal trait did not show mediating effect.

Although privately recognizing social problems concerning the neighbourhood and its residents, who live in marginal social conditions, local authorities are silent vis-à-vis these issues. Drawing on long-term fieldwork and analysis of local media and policy texts, I show that in the absence of local authorities’ official discourses on Roma and the neighbourhood, social order is continually maintained through an unofficial complex dynamic, which I call ‘urban governance apparatus’. I show that this ‘apparatus’ is composed of three elements, namely (1) public policy in the neighbourhood; (2) urban Roma stigma; and (3) what I call ‘surreptitious gazing’ in the neighbourhood. My argument is that when urban governance involves major tacit and unofficial dynamics – and this is especially true when unrecognized minorities are involved – the concept of ‘urban governance apparatus’ may better serve the aim of analysing and understanding certain local power dynamics. © 2013, © The Author(s) 2013.","Ethnography; Italy; Pescara; Roma; unrecognized minorities; urban governance apparatus",,,"SAGE Publications Ltd",,,,,09697764,,,"English","Eur.

Comparability of results and consistency of the models have also been studied here. The study has analyzed specific features of applying DEA models to evaluate efficiency of Russian HEIs, depending on the type of university. Performance of Russian HEIs has been compared with regard to their resource potential in educational and scientific activities. It has been discovered that in general, both classical and technical universities in Russia have more potential in educational activities than in science. Meanwhile, technical universities have a higher overall scientific and educational potential (70-90%) than classical universities (50-60%). A comparison of performance of Russian and foreign universities has shown that efficiency level in Russia is higher than in Germany, nearly the same as in Australia and lower than in Canada and in Great Britain. It has been demonstrated through the example of Russian universities that efficiency evaluation should only be performed for universities with similar profiles and basic features. Evaluation of performance of universities allows to reveal their strengths and weaknesses and, knowing this, to build efficient development strategies for each of them.","Data Envelopment Analysis; Efficiency evaluation; Higher education institutions",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

The fundamental hypothesis was that the academic progress of a pupil contributes to his or her popularity in classes with high motivation, where most children are well disposed towards education, and results in waning popularity in classes with low motivation. The second hypothesis was that the connection between popularity and academic progress was stronger for girls than for boys. The sociometric popularity is determined by a number of friendly nominations received by a pupil from his or her classmates. The academic context of a class is defined as an aggregated characteristic of all pupils' individual academic motivation. To measure individual motivation, the Study involvement scale comprised of 10 questions was used. The academic progress was measured by means of an average score of final marks for a previous term in 5 subjects: Russian language, Algebra, A foreign language, Biology, Physics. In the study 5904 pupils (309 classes, 101 schools of Saint-Petersburg) of the 8-10th grades (14-16 years of age) took part. Data were analyzed by means of a multilevel regression analysis (HLM7). Reliability of the received results was confirmed by a special dyad analysis for network data (p2). The received results prove a gender specificity of popularity factors. Good progress is more important for girls' popularity than for boys' popularity. Girls' popularity is positively associated with an average score, regardless of a class context. A connection between boys' marks and their popularity depends on the context: in classes with high academic motivation this association is positive, in classes with low motivation it is negative. The study revealed threshold effects: the context influence becomes apparent only if a class motivation level achieves extreme values. In classes with extremely low academic motivation boys who study well face danger of marginalization. The authors offer to use data concerning popularity of different categories of pupils when evaluating an educational setting quality, in particular to determine problem classes.","Academic progress; School children; School setting; Social network analysis; Social status; Sociometric popularity",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Some destinations boast a specific gastronomic brand, while others do not have a clearly defined 'gastronomic face'. Moreover, some territories lack the 'food basis' or unique gastronomic resources, such as a brand product or local cuisine, for creating such a brand. The authors undertook an investigation of whether a territorial gastronomic brand can be formed when a region lacks a definite 'food basis'. What is the basis for creating a regional gastronomic brand (RGB)? Does the 'food basis' always form the nucleus of a gastronomic brand? Or within the framework of the experience economy, is a 'non-culinary', 'non-food' addition sufficient for creating an RGB? The authors argue that the basis for a gastronomic brand can be traced to the cultural and historic traditions of the region. The authors focus on possible ways of forming gastronomic brands in multicultural cosmopolitan cities where authentic gastronomic brands are blurred to a great extent.

Time perspective, hardiness, selfefficacy, achievement motivation, affiliation motivation, and locus of control can be considered personality copingresources. The combination of them and the degree of their intensity can be connected with the choice of specific coping strategies. Therefore, the goal of the research was investigating personality types of coping behaviour in an interpersonal conflict. The results of the empirical research (331 respondents) are given in this article. Classification of personality types showing various features of coping behaviour in a situation of an interpersonal conflict was the result of the research. Four personality types were differentiated - dependent, steady, unsteady and diffuse. The research allows us to suggest that the hardiness level has become the main factor in the choice of coping strategies. When it is not high, a person chooses emotional strategies, and strongly pronounced hardiness determines the choice of cognitive strategies. © Common Ground, Milana Hachaturova, All Rights Reserved.","Achievement Motivation; Affiliation Motivation; Coping Strategy; Hardiness; Interpersonal Conflict; Locus of Control; Personality Type; Self-efficacy; Time Perspective",,,"Common Ground Research Networks",,,,,23247576,,,"English","Int.

The reviewer determines and comments on the key issues covered in the book, such as: choosing a language of education, teaching languages in school, discursive practices widely used in schools, role of language socialization and language stereotypes in academic achievements of students. Bringing these subject matters together is explained by a strong intention to involve sociolinguistic methods and theories as much as possible into understanding school language processes. Attention is drawn to the fact that the book is a crossroads of some major subject matters that have been isolated from each other in sociolinguistics and have been studied by isolated teams of researchers who almost never appealed to each other in their studies. Thus, a comprehensive sociolinguistic view of the school is provided. An analysis is made of how the authors of the book develop a problem field dubbed as ""school sociolinguistics"". Research in this area has great prospects, as collected comparison materials and analytical findings demonstrate how many school education issues should be seen through the language glass and how little attention is paid to them in Russian educational surveys. In each chapter, the book provides an overview of general conceptual framework, known results, and numerous examples of language situations in different societies. Survey results are never transferred from one culture to another in this book.

Cross tabulation and correlation analysis of questionnaire data have revealed a positive though insignificant interdependence between parental education and high-school students' educational trajectories and academic achievements. Gender and ethnic group have proven to be the best predictors of academic progress; in particular, female students have better performance than males and Tatar-speaking students outperform Russian speakers. Educational trajectories depend mostly on gender (20% more female students plan to get higher education). Regression and discriminant analyses have shown that, to predict academic progress, one should take into account education of parents (mostly fathers) and other independent variables: cultural capital, non-cognitive skills, peers' attitude towards education, health, ethnicity and gender. Higher education prospects are determined by education of parents (mostly fathers). However, performance and gender variables also contribute to the statistics (high performance gives more chances for higher education; female students are more likely to get higher education than male students). Based on the data obtained, it is recommended to adjust the education strategy in Tatarstan in order to improve academic performance in two heterogeneous groups - male students and Russian-speaking students. Weak connection between student performance and parental education eliminates the need to level down the effects of poor parental education.","Academic progress; Educational trajectory; Human capital; Parental education; Student performance; Tatarstan",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

In our research, we outlined a number of methods to develop time competence, various conscious and unconscious ways to organize time, and to create an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, and trust in the process of interpersonal non-verbal communication. It can be noted that time characteristics of social behavior and its non-verbal manifestation can exert a positive influence on a person's communicative activity, and determine their time competence in communication. Ignoring time parameters of self-realization and self-actualization of personality introduces a certain destructive element in the process of interpersonal relations. Hence, there arises the necessity of teaching communicative competence in communication.

There is an extensive literature review in the article where the authors analyze in detail foreign and national hands-on experiences of account taken of territory factors in educational inequality studies. In Russia the basic problem that didn't let to work out an accurate and differential estimate of territory development at the level of municipal units until quite recently was an absence of the corresponding statistics. In 2011 the Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) for the first time opened access to a database with information from municipal units' statistical passports. The authors analyze how differences in educational results between Russian schools are connected to their differences in 1) social and economic characteristics of pupils and their families; 2) physical and human resources; 3) certain territory development indicators depending on where the schools are situated. The authors used data from social passports collected during surveys in schools of the Moscow and the Yaroslav regions in 2011-2012, as well as municipal statistics data which enable to estimate a level of social and economic deprivation in settlements of different types on the basis of a limited set of indicators. In the statistical analysis a two-level regression model was used. A multilevel analysis enables first of all to find out how variables measured at the level of both schools and settlements are connected to an average mark for Unified state exam; in the second place it enables to check if a nature of connection between variables measured at the level of schools and the average mark for USE depends on characteristics of the settlements (by means of interaction effects); and in the third place it enables to estimate to what extent a connection between characteristics of schools and the average mark for USE in different settlements is different (by means of the so-called random effects). The analysis results make it possible to state that the academic progress determined on the basis of aver-age marks for Russian language and Mathematics USE is indeed consistently different in schools with 1) different social structure and 2) different physical and human resources. A level of territory deprivation in itself does not influence educational results: typically poor training outcomes that are observed for example in country schools can be explained by resource scarcity and their specific social structure characteristics.","Education quality assessment; Educational results; Schools; Socioeconomic deprivation; Socioeconomic status of family; Unified State Exam",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Perspectives of the problem are compared to some theories by Basil Bernstein, Pierre Bourdieu, and John Coleman that were not covered by Hall and Farkas. Discussing the conclusions Hall and Farkas made on recruiting and evaluating job candidates from different racial and ethnic groups, the author refers to works of other researchers, finds parallels in some of the points, and reveals the critical distinctive features of Hall and Farkas's theory of factors affecting career advancement. Employer expectation transformations in the US and Russia are also compared in the paper. While analyzing the practical tips given by Hall and Farkas on reducing ethnic discrimination in the labor market (reducing differences between cognitive skills and attitudinal/behavioral traits of black/Latino and white students and developing correction education and professional orientation programs), the author admits that the measures proposed are potentially very helpful though insufficient to eliminate cultural factors of stereotyped attitudes towards different ethnic and racial groups engrained in collective consciousness.

Polivanova investigates into the notion of ""identity"" that Gee considers the original home of any human action, where newcomers realize their belonging to a social group and accept its appreciative systems. She discusses the problem of student identity in learning and the risks of buying into the identity of being a ""good student"", instead of buying into disciplines. The identity of following the learning rules distorts motivation for cognitive activities, creating an attitude of learning to avoid sanctions instead of learning for knowledge. Gee's idea of self-assessment as an ultimate point of learning is analyzed in the context of the Russian theory of action. Polivanova points to the break-through nature of seeing self-assessment as a means of maintaining identity. The commentary examines importance of the game in educational practices and relationship between knowledge and competencies. Gee's attitude towards formal assessment is presented. Polivanova also describes Gee's types of learning in the 19th century, which get more and more promising as new opportunities for modeling learning environments appear.","Activity theory; Assessment; Interiorization; Learning; Play; Self-appraisal; Social groups",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

The paper studies how informal education system is related with everyday activists' practices and identifies structural organization of this system and its consistency with political and philosophical attitudes in the community. It has been discovered that, despite severe criticism of formal education system, education remains highly appreciated by anarchists. Thus, they mostly trust informal education channels, as independent sources of information. Social space of informal education is represented by communication, i.e. adherents translate key anarchist values through everyday interpersonal communication and demonstrate their belonging to the community through reference to important texts, names, and events. An informal education system in a subcultural environment is formed the same way as formal systems are formed: knowledge is selected, legitimized, optimized, and reproduced in compliance with ideological principles. Ideology is transparent in informal education, unlike in formal one. Subject areas of anarchist informal education are integrated in activist and political projects and related to anarchist philosophy and everyday life. As individuals are involved into informal education practices based on alternative interpretation of existing economic, governmental, and social structures, it results in changing their vision of the world and reorganizing their essential strategies and everyday practices. The analysis has demonstrated how informal knowledge systems can replace formal ones and produce new forms of sociality, changing not only parlance but also lifestyle, activities, and consumer practices of adherents.","Anarchists; Critical pedagogy; Informal education; Libertarian pedagogy; Lifelong learning; Self-education; Spontaneous education; Youth communities; Youth movements; Youth subcultures",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

Policy-makers and experts are challenged to elucidate its distinct paths in different economies, to show why some countries succeed and others fail on their way towards modernization, and to identify the factors that make success stories. In this case, close attention is paid to the linkages between modernization and value systems, in particular, to tolerance. The aim of this paper is to test empirically the assumption that tolerance exerts a significant positive influence on modernization (which is understood in its 'narrow' sense as economic and technological development) as well as the contribution of an enabling mechanism - political institutions. The theoretical frameworks of our study are the cultural modernization approach by Ronald Inglehart and the concept of the ""creative class"" by Richard Florida. We used data from 58 countries over 1996-2008, retrieved from the World Values Survey, as well as from the World Bank databases ""World Development Indicators"" and ""Worldwide Governance Indicators"". The analysis confirmed that tolerance does have a significant impact on modernization in terms of transition towards a post-industrial (innovation) economy. This process is associated with the emergence of a specific social class - a creative class. Tolerance, expressed as a tolerant attitude towards homosexuality, gender equality, and a decrease in xenophobia, is a crucial prerequisite in establishing and maintaining favorable conditions for attracting creative people. Two distinct patterns of modernization are revealed, depending on the level of social tolerance: a tolerant model and a catch-up model. The post-industrial economy requires the formation of a relevant society based on the values of self-expression. However, some countries try to build a post-industrial economy without building a post-industrial society, although the probability of success in this case is rather low. This catch-up model focuses on investment, a lower-level of tolerance, and weak political institutions. The latter matter especially, and they seem to be the causal mechanism to ensure the linkages between tolerance and successful modernization. First of all, the linkage emerges from the rule of law and control of corruption. Institutions are regarded as a key element in the tolerant model of modernization, ensuring creative people to maintain openness, diversity, and protection of their interests, including the right to identity. Catch-up strategy, in contrast, puts the main emphasis not on values and strengthening institutions, but on higher investment rates.","Creative class; Cultural change; Innovation; Institutions; Investment; Modernization; Tolerance",,,"National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics",,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902441406

Pattern structures are used in FCA for dealing with complex data such as intervals or graphs. Here they are adapted to sequences. For that, we introduce a subsumption operation for sequence comparison, based on subsequence matching. Then, a projection, i.e. a kind of data reduction of sequential pattern structures, is suggested in order to increase the efficiency of the approach. Finally, we discuss an application to a dataset including patient trajectories (the motivation of this work), which is a sequential dataset and can be processed with the introduced framework.

This is not so if the similarity matrix is preprocessed by subtraction of ""noise"", of which two ways, the uniform and modularity, are analyzed in the chapter. Another criterion under consideration is the semi-average within-cluster similarity, which manifests more versatile properties. In fact, both types of criteria emerge in relation to the least-squares data approximation approach to clustering, as shown in the chapter. A very simple local optimization algorithm, Add-and-Remove(S), leads to a suboptimal cluster satisfying some tightness conditions. Three versions of an iterative extraction approach are considered, leading to a portrayal of the cluster structure of the data. Of these, probably most promising is what is referred to as the injunctive clustering approach.

In such an environment, PMGs increase the value of buying the good and therefore increase consumers' reservation prices. This increase is so large that even after accounting for the possible execution of PMGs, firms' profits are larger in an equilibrium where PMGs are offered than in an equilibrium without PMGs. We also consider the incentives of firms to choose PMGs and show that an equilibrium where all firms offer PMGs does not exist because of a free-riding problem. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Price matching guarantees; Sequential search; Welfare analysis","Free-riding; Market outcomes; Price matching guarantees; Reservation price; Sequential search; Welfare analysis; Industry; Profitability; Costs",,,,,,,01677187,,IJIOD,"English","Int J Ind Organiz",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870188473

A simple method of evaluation of interdependences between integral characteristics of Hall thrusters with anode layer is suggested. The equation of balance of the forces acting on a region with a Hall current and the relation between current of the accelerated ions and the flow rate of working gas are taken into consideration. Given that the geometrical parameters of the specific Hall thruster are fixed this model allows to relate to each other the basic integral characteristics of the thruster, such as accelerating voltage, magnetic field strength, the flow rate of working gas and the current of the accelerated ions. The numerical estimations are presented for one of the most commonly used Hall thrusters with anode layer - TAL-WSF. The region of discharge existence in the channel of the Hall thruster is considered. It is shown, that a rather small demagnetization is typical for Hall thrusters with anode layer, that is the ratio of the strength of magnetic field near anode boundary of Hall current layer to the strength of magnetic field on its cathode boundary is close to 1. It is shown, that taking into account the kinetic effects at free- molecule flow of neutral particles (a preferential depletion of tangentially flying particles and slowly flying particles) leads to decrease of a current of the accelerated ions and thrust of the thruster. The initial heating of working gas also leads to decrease of thrust. The suggested method can be used in engineering of new Hall thrusters for estimation of their parameters. Application of suggested method to stationary plasma thrusters also gives acceptable results.

Solar radiation pressure accelerates a spacecraft without any fuel costs and can thus be used to substitute for traditional jets to accomplish many space missions. If the surface has variable reflective characteristics, for instance, using electric current, then solar pressure control can generate rotational torques for attitude control. Consider a solar sail with six spheres attached by mutually orthogonal long rods. Each sphere's entire surface is divided into pixels and each pixel can be specified in an active or non-active mode. Active pixels reflect most of the radiation while non-active pixels absorb it. Consequently, the radiation pressure force on each pixel in different modes is different. In this work, it is shown that after determining the necessary dimensions of the solar sail's structure, pixel reflectance control allows rotation of the entire structure with known moments of inertia around any axis with a predefined accuracy. The spacecraft is assumed to be in an Earth orbit, so gravity gradient torque is considered as another major impact that depends on the orbital altitude. A special program written in C++ was developed that establishes the required parameters of this solar sail and executes an algorithm of rotation around an arbitrary axis with predefined orientation. In each time point, it calculates the appropriate pixel configuration, defines attitude, rotation moments, angular velocities and simulates the full structure's rotation. After program testing, analytical results were obtained, including estimation of rotation torques and angular velocity that depend on the space vehicle's geometry and mass parameters, optical coefficients of the material and the pixel size. These parameters can be used to determine the feasibility of executing the rotation maneuver with such a solar sail in a real space mission. The evaluation the length of rods and the radius of the spheres for the maneuver provides a chance for engineering accomplishment.

Two sets of pronatalist measures were implemented during the past 40 years. The one designed in the early 1980s proved to be a clear failure. Instead of raising fertility, completed cohort fertility declined from 1.8 births per woman for the 1960 birth cohort to 1.6 for the 1968 cohort. The government of President Putin became concerned with the dire demographic conditions of high mortality and low fertility in Russia in the 1990s and early 2000s. A comprehensive set of pronatalist measures came into effect in January 2007. The period total fertility rate increased from 1.3 births per woman in 2006 to 1.6 in 2011, which the authorities view as an unqualified success. An unbiased demographic evaluation as well as analyses of Russian experts reveals that apparently the measures mainly caused a lowering of the age at birth and shortening of birth intervals. It appears that any real fertility increase is questionable, i.e. cohort fertility is not likely to increase appreciably. The recent pronatalist measures are likely to turn out to be a failure. © 2013 The Population Council, Inc.",,"cohort analysis; family structure; fertility; mortality; social policy; Russian Federation",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",,,,,00987921,,,"English","Popul.

Our enhancements include: applying ILS heuristic by Andrade, Resende and Werneck (in Heuristics 18:525-547, 2012) to find a high-quality initial solution, fast detection of clique vertices in a set of candidates, better initial coloring, and avoiding dynamic memory allocation. A good initial solution considerably reduces the search tree size due to early pruning of branches related to small cliques. Fast detecting of clique vertices is based on coloring. Whenever a set of candidates contains a vertex adjacent to all candidates, we detect it immediately by its color and add it to the current clique avoiding unnecessary branching. Though dynamic memory allocation allows to minimize memory consumption of the program, it increases the total running time. Our computational experiments show that for dense graphs with a moderate number of vertices (like the majority of DIMACS graphs) it is more efficient to store vertices of a set of candidates and their colors on stack rather than in dynamic memory on all levels of recursion.

The mast is a statically determinate truss, consisting of three identical plane trusses connected to the regular truncated pyramid. Vertical truss is divided into n zones of equal height. The load is reduced to the nodes of the upper boom of the mast. The analytical solution for the forces in the spatial truss rods for an arbitrary number of horizontal contours, and the expression for the deflection under the assumption that the angles of deviation from the vertical of struts are small, are given. The resulting approximate and exact analytical solutions for the deflection under the action of horizontal load allow optimization of the construction. One of the possibilities for optimization is the redistribution of the material between the elements of the construction. An analytical solution of this problem is found.

We assume that the COP has an additive (separable) objective function and the structure of a feasible (optimal) solution to the COP is predefined by a collection of cells (positions) in an input file. We define a pattern as a collection of positions in an instance problem represented by its input file (matrix). We illustrate the notion of pattern by means of some well-known problems in COP, among them are the linear ordering problem (LOP) and cell formation problem (CFP), just to mention a couple. The CFP is defined on a Boolean input matrix, the rows of which represent machines and columns - parts. The CFP consists in finding three optimal objects: a block-diagonal collection of rectangles, a row (machines) permutation, and a column (parts) permutation such that the grouping efficacy is maximized. The suggested heuristic combines two procedures: the pattern-based procedure to build an initial solution and an improvement procedure to obtain a final solution with high grouping efficacy for the CFP. Our computational experiments with the most popular set of 35 benchmark instances show that our heuristic outperforms all well-known heuristics and returns either the best known or improved solutions to the CFP. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.","Cell formation problem; Group technology; Heuristic","Benchmarking; Cellular manufacturing; Optimization; Cell formation problem; Combinatorial optimization problems; Computational experiment; Design heuristics; Heuristic; Linear assignment; Linear ordering problems; Objective functions; Group technology",,"Springer New York LLC",,,,,21941009,9781461455738,,"English","Springer Proc.

Moreover, this burden is exponentially growing. In order to efficiently handle the enterprise content, a systematic approach is required, which embraces object-based models and software engineering tools. The paper outlines the approach, and gives the primary attention to the formal models for content management. The formal models are fully supported by problem-oriented languages and CASE level tools. The proposed approach has been extended for application in project integration management. The paper also suggests the method of dynamic modeling of planning and change management processes taking into account particular project constraints, priorities, environment etc. This method is based on ER-model of project structures (WBS, OBS, TRM, network etc.) and the Selective-function Linear resolution for Definite Clause. The resolution procedure defines the sequence of the project structures determination i.e. the management process including inputs and outputs on the basis of specified initial conditions. This method was applied in a consulting project in public management domain. It could be implemented as a web-service for another web-based Enterprise Project Management Systems or as a stand-alone solution with GUI. The approach has been approved by a number of successful enterprise-scale implementations in oil-and-gas industry, public management, trading and banking enterprises, nuclear power plant construction and other areas.

The experience of American universities is analyzed with regard to major aspects of possible pedagogical education reform in Russia.It is suggested that modernization of Russian pedagogical education system should bring together advantages of Russian universities and the most efficient foreign practices. Due to unverified validity and high financial cost, it is not recommended to adopt wide use of alternative pedagogical education programs and the Added Value Model in assessing performance of faculties of education based on achievements of students taught by graduates. Emphasis is placed on the positive experience of the American professional accreditation system, the two-level teaching certification, elements of the Clinical Model of teacher education designed to develop partner relationship between universities and schools and involving intensive teaching practices, and active teacher internship in schools allowing to increase significantly the quality of education and to reduce staff turnover rate. The author sees the most appropriate form of accreditation for Russian teaching programs in enhancing the existing uniform accreditation system while applying specific standards and requirements to fields of study in education. Practical tips are given to transform the existing standards. The author discusses feasibility of integrating pedagogical HE institutions with universities and alternative ways to develop the former. He explores opportunities for attracting talented candidates to pedagogical institutions and advantages that the double degree educational system provides for training experts of better qualification using Master's degree programs.","Accreditation; Educational standards; Master's programs; Online education; Teacher training; Teaching quality assessment",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

S. Vygotsky and his adherents. The authors put forward and empirically tested two hypotheses for the academic content acquisition process that followed from this theory. The first one concerns an underlying logic of this process, that is an indispensable sequence of its stages and results description of which forms a taxonomy of educational objectives. The study tests the taxonomy that is based on a symbol acquisition level scheme outlined by L. S. Vygotsky and specified by V. V. Davydov and his colleagues in their works. The second hypothesis concerns a temporal property of the acquisition defined by two theoretical constructs: the notion of a zone of proximal development (L. S. Vygotsky), according to which real academic content acquisition extends beyond the training process time frame, and cultural development periodization (D. B. Elkonin) which describes how the training is included into the maturation process. The study used a set of level school tests developed by a group of Russian experts who were guided by the cultural development theory - Student Achievement Monitoring (SAM). Pupils of different ages from different regions of Russia were tested for acquisition of the Elementary School Mathematics and Russian language program. The first hypothesis was tested as part of a paper test appraisal in some regions of the Russian Federation in spring of 2012. More than 5000 fourth-grade pupils of comprehensive schools took part in the appraisal process. The second hypothesis was tested as part of a special study comprised of two stages. At the first stage SAM tests of Mathematics and Russian language were given to the 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th grade pupils. At the second stage, in a year, the same pupils took the same tests, and repeated cross sections were formed. The study results on the whole support the offered level scheme: as regards most units of tasks that are formed according to criteria specified in the taxonomy, the tasks of the first, second and third levels create a corresponding hierarchy in terms of complexity. And what is more, in most cases the complexity increase from the first level to the second and to the third levels is clearly statistically significant. The received results also validate the hypothesis that the acquisition process is considerably outside the scope of training in itself: full acquisition of the elementary school academic content takes place approximately by the end of the middle school.","Acquisition level; Orientation; Symbol; Training; Zone of proximal development",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

They aim to attract leading international scientists as well as young scholars and thus to help increase national research capabilities. This paper analyses the efficiency of international labs in achieving these goals in terms of criteria that are intrinsic (number of publications, patents etc.) and perceived (job satisfaction). Motivation and involvement of employees as well as availability of resources are regarded as the main determinants of efficiency. Based on previous international and domestic studies in the field we build a conceptual model to estimate causal relations and correlations between these five variables. Our data source was the online survey of international scientific laboratories staff, which was conducted in April-June, 2012. The paper first describes the sample characteristics, then carries out factor analysis of motivation resulting in a typology, and, finally, presents a structural equation modeling to test the conceptual framework of analysis. Factor analysis reveals that four important groups of employee motives exist. Laboratory staff may be motivated (or unmotivated) by achievement in science, focus on careers abroad, practical-oriented material values and satisfaction with working conditions. Using structural equation modeling authors provide empirical evidence for the hypothesis about relations between employee engagement and job satisfaction. The more employees are engaged in lab activities, the higher are job satisfaction and productivity level. However, the strength of these effects is relatively small. The assumption of a positive relationship between job satisfaction and available resources was also confirmed. Additionally, analysis showed that employee engagement has a positive effect on the achievement of both objective and subjective results.","International research centers; Job satisfaction; Motivation; Research efficiency; Researchers; Resources; Results",,,"National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics",,,,,1995459X,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902484235

Jupiter's satellite Europa is close in size to the Moon. Its surface is covered with a layer of ice crust of thickness 10-30 km. Europa's surface is of large interest, because under the ice crust there is an ocean of liquid water creating conditions for possible life. The entire ice surface of the satellite is covered with a system of bands, valleys, and ridges. These structures are explained by the fact, that the ice surface is rather mobile and it was repeatedly broken from internal stresses and large-scale tectonic processes. The analysis performed showed that compressing, extending, shearing and bending stresses can influence some arbitrarily separated section of Europe's ice surface. The computer simulation with a finite element method (FEM) was performed to see, what types of defects could arise from such effects. The heterogeneity of the satellite's ice cover in thickness, density and temperature was taking into account during the simulation. The calculations, carried out for the cross-section of a thawed ice structure's area, have shown that, the most dangerous, from the crack formation viewpoint, is the shear stress at loading application angles of ±90°. Using models of thawed ice patches in the distributed field of temperatures, the effect of mechanical gravitation-tidal forces on the formation of surface defects on Europa was studied. It is shown that fractures and cracks can have various forms depending on the stress-strained state arising in their vicinity. The formation of such defects is caused by the chaotic set of many factors, mechanic and temperature ones predominantly. Copyright © 2013 by the International Astronautical Federation.

However, this criterion is hardly ever used to evaluate some investment instruments (e.g. short sales, options, futures, swaps) on the stock market. This is partially due to the fact that such instruments generate non-conventional cash flows, and, consequently, the IRR may be irrelevant or impossible to determine. The IRR may also be impossible to calculate in case of portfolios with withdrawals and contributions during the period evaluated, for which reason it is not always applied. This paper suggests the generalized average rate of return (GARR) without the disadvantages inherent to the IRR. This criterion also allows the authors to make the return concept more specific and internally consistent and reinforce the risk/return principle by using relevant methods for evaluation of investment instruments with non-conventional cash flows.","Capital budgeting; Investment instruments; Multiple internal rates of return; Non-conventional cash flows","Budget control; Earnings; Exhibitions; Investments; Average rate; Capital budgeting; Cash flow; Internal rate of return; Multiple internal rates of return; Stock market; Instruments","Arena;Boeing;et al.;FedEx Ground;The Ergonomics Center of North Carolina;The Hershey Company","Institute of Industrial Engineers","IIE Annual Conference and Expo 2013","18 May 2013 through 22 May 2013","San Juan",104963,,,,"English","IIE Annu.

The reason is that tournaments allow the principal to trade insurance for lower income to the agents. Our analysis shows that this celebrated result does not carry over to the case when a limited liability (bankruptcy) constraint limits the payments the principal can make, provided that the liquidation value of the firm is sufficiently small. This finding has important implications for the vast number of limited liability firms. Even though limited liability becomes an issue for different ranges of liquidation values under the two schemes, tournaments are still superior when the liquidation value of the firm is intermediate or large, even though the limited liability constraint is still binding for intermediate values. Surprisingly, uncertainty in the price of output strengthens the need for tournaments by expanding the range of liquidation values over which tournaments are dominant, because price uncertainty introduces additional bankruptcy risk. These findings provide insight into policy implications in the contracting out of services by state and local governments, in procurement, in rent-seeking contests and in tournaments used by HMOs. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The excellence ""accelerators"" are specified. The paper studies various options of excellence initiative development and implementation, pointing to pros and cons of each of them. Using international experience and assessing the recent reforms in Russian tertiary education, the authors come to the conclusion that projects designed to make Russian universities more competitive should have the following objectives: active development of multidisciplinary centers of excellence and postgraduate programs in major universities; targeted funding to support promising young researchers; internationalization of education; reformation of the management system. The essential prerequisites for excellence initiatives should be consistent funding and an infrastructure comparable to that of globally competitive universities. It is emphasized that excellence initiatives designed to support research universities still leave open the need for systemic reforms in education, which are supposed to enhance the effects of excellence initiatives.","Excellence initiatives; Federal universities; Financing of education; International rankings; National research universities; Reforming university system",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

The limiting current of the quasineutral ion beam with the total current of the order of one ampere and a small amount of kinetic energy (100 ÷300 eV) in laboratory conditions, namely in the drift tube filled with own gas, is considered. The total time of neutralization of the ion beam in a drift tube and the duration of the process of ion- beam plasma formation are estimated. The problem of electrostatic instability of quasineutral ion beam in a drift tube is considered. The limiting current of electrostatic instability of the quasineutral ion beam represents threshold value of a current above which instability develops without any initial perturbations from infinitely small random fluctuation of potential. In real conditions practically always there are initial perturbations of the ion beam current. For this reason the problem of dynamic decompensation at a finite depth current modulation of the quasineutral ion beam is also considered. Modulation of the ion current leads to a pulsation of the ion beam charge, that, in turn, leads to modulation of ion-beam plasma potential and, hence, of accelerating voltage. It is shown, that the limiting current of electrostatic instability of the quasineutral ion beam in a drift tube is proportional to the concentration of residual gas, to the radius of a drift tube, to the cube of an accelerating voltage and inversely proportional to the potential of ion-beam plasma raised to power of one and a half. It is shown, that the influence of finite modulation of the ion beam current leads to decrease of the instability threshold.Copyright ©2013 by the International Astronautical Federation.",,"Beam plasma interactions; Drift chambers; Hall thrusters; Kinetics; Magnetoplasma; Modulation; Tubes (components); Accelerating voltages; Analysis of stability; Current modulation; Electrostatic instabilities; Initial perturbation; Laboratory conditions; Operating condition; Random fluctuation; Ion beams","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","64th International Astronautical Congress 2013, IAC 2013","23 September 2013 through 27 September 2013","Beijing",106314,00741795,9781629939094,,"English","Proc.

We hypothesise that not industry variety per se but variety of related industries significantly contributes to economic growth in Russian regions. First, we test for the existence of spatial dependence in economic growth across Russian regions using three traditional indicators of technological progress. Second, we construct a simple theoretical model where economic growth is exogenously determined and depends primarily on export externalities. The paper shows that export externalities have a positive and significant impact on employment growth in most sectors of the economy. Simultaneously, spatially lagged export productivity has varying effects on employment growth depending on the sector, which is decelerating economic growth in industrial sectors and accelerating economic development in the most advanced service sectors.

The proposed approach to transforming data, when transferring them between individual applications or services of the system, is to convert input messages into output messages using an intermediate canonical representation of the data via rules that map the source model to the canonical one, and the canonical model to the target. Since the canonical model of a subject area serves a technical important task and is not intended for human use, it may be generated automatically instead of manually and designed 'from scratch', as a 'union' of models used in the various application parts of the system. Subject area models of the application parts being integrated may be written using different formalisms, and yet another formalism may be used for the canonical model, so that a mechanism is required to automatically capture various concepts expressed in various formal systems. In the present paper we focus on developing such a mechanism, based on the automatic generation of a (somewhat simplified) representation of the most important kinds of entities in the canonical model. © 2013 IEEE.","Conceptual modeling; Data integration; Data transformation; Enterprise Service Bus; Integration Bus","Data integration; Metadata; Automatic Generation; Canonical modeling; Canonical representations; Conceptual model; Data transformation; Enterprise service bus; Source modeling; Synthetic approach; Buses","","IEEE Computer Society","2013 3rd International Symposium ISKO-Maghreb","8 November 2013 through 9 November 2013","Marrakesh",102736,,9781479933921,,"English","Int.

Basing on previous researches, we develop a vector database schema for quadruples, its realization on index data structures, and ways to efficiently implement the joining of two and more data sets simultaneously. We also offer approaches to optimizing the SPARQL query execution plan which is based on its heuristic transformations. The query performance efficiency is checked and proved on BSBM tests. The study results can be taken into consideration during the development of RDF DBMS's suitable for storing large volumes of Semantic Web data, as well as for the creation of large-scale repositories of semantic data. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Index; Multiple joins; Query optimization; RDF; SPARQL","Bridges; Knowledge engineering; Optimization; Query processing; Database schemas; Fundamental design; Index; Index data structures; Query optimization; Query performance; RDF; SPARQL; Semantic Web","Eventos;LOD2;Russian Foundation for Basic Research;STI Innsbruck","Springer Verlag","4th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Semantic Web, KESW 2013","7 October 2013 through 9 October 2013","St. Petersburg",99660,18650929,9783642413599,,"English","Commun.

In this problem, we need 1) to choose a set of transportation demands between stations in a railroad network, and 2) to fulfill these demands by appropriately routing the set of available railcars, while maximizing the total profit. We formulate this problem as a multi-commodity flow problem in a large space-time graph. Three approaches are proposed to solve the Linear Programming relaxation of this formulation: direct solution by an LP solver, a column generation approach based on the path reformulation, and a ""column generation for extended formulations"" approach. In the latter, the multi-commodity flow formulation is solved iteratively by dynamic generation of arc flow variables. Three approaches have been tested on a set of real-life instances provided by one of the largest freight rail transportation companies in Russia. Instances with up to 10 millions of arc flow variables were solved within minutes of computational time.","Column generation; Freight routing; Multi-commodity flow","Iterative methods; Linear programming; Rail motor cars; Railroad transportation; Column generation; Column generation approach; Extended formulations; Freight routing; Linear programming relaxation; Multi-commodity flow; Rail transportation; Transportation demand; Flow graphs","","Schloss Dagstuhl- Leibniz-Zentrum fur Informatik GmbH, Dagstuhl Publishing","13th Workshop on Algorithmic Approaches for Transportation Modelling, Optimization, and Systems, ATMOS 2013","5 September 2013 through 5 September 2013","Sophia Antipolis",106834,21906807,9783939897583,,"English","OpenAccess Ser.

Adaptation of neuronal networks to the cultured conditioning in the absence of external drive stimulates appearance of self-sustained spiking patterns without any specific stimuli. Some alteration like electrical stimulation, medium changing, metabolic activation, or depression of mature culture evokes to novel properties of spiking pattern. These properties are reversible usually and may be considered as a new function system occurring in consequence of strong stimulations. Intracellular calcium transients are the basic signaling mechanisms in nerve cells in addition to membrane potential. However, little is known about the transition of spontaneous intracellular calcium dynamics and the relationship between calcium transients and electrical activity during network development. To identify function neuronal networks in vitro we investigated spontaneous intracellular calcium transients in mouse hippocampal networks cultured on MEA for month after plating. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.","Electrical stimulation; Intracellular calcium dynamics; Medium changing; Metabolic activation or depression; Microelectrode arrays; Mouse hippocampal networks; Neuronal networks; Self-sustained spiking patterns","Calcium; Electric properties; Mammals; Metabolism; Neurons; Transients; Electrical stimulations; Intracellular calcium; Medium changing; Metabolic activation; Microelectrode array; Neuronal networks; Spiking patterns; Neural networks",,"Springer New York LLC",,,,,21941009,9781461455738,,"English","Springer Proc.

It continues related work on mining deterministic behavior rules of human subjects in data gathered from experiments. Game-theoretic predictions partially fail to work with this data. Equilibria also known as game-theoretic predictions solely succeed with experienced subjects in specific games - conditions, which are rarely given. Contemporary experimental economics offers a number of alternative models apart from game theory. In relevant literature, these models are always biased by philosophical plausibility considerations and are claimed to fit the data. An agnostic data mining approach to the problem is introduced in this paper - the philosophical plausibility considerations follow after the correlations are found. No other biases are regarded apart from determinism. The dataset of the paper ''Social Learning in Networks' by Choi et al 2012 is taken for evaluation. As a result, we come up with new findings.

A single slot is a time span that can be assigned to a task, which is a part of a job. The job launch requires a co-allocation of a specified number of slots starting synchronously. The challenge is that slots associated with different CPU nodes of distributed computational environments may have arbitrary start and finish points that do not match. Some existing algorithms assigns a job to the first set of slots matching the resource request without any optimization (the first fit type), while other algorithms are based on an exhaustive search. In this paper, algorithms for effective slot selection of linear complexity are studied and compared with known decisions. The proposed algorithms allow overall increase in the quality of service (QoS) for each of the considered rates: job start time, finish time, runtime, CPU usage time and total cost of job execution. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.",,"Distributed computer systems; Quality of service; Scheduling; Co-allocation; Computational environments; Economic scheduling; Job execution; Linear complexity; Non-dedicated resources; Resource request; Selection algorithm; Algorithms","","Springer Verlag","8th International Conference on Dependability and Complex Systems, DepCoS-RELCOMEX 2013","9 September 2013 through 13 September 2013","Brunow",98895,21945357,9783319009445,,"English","Adv.

Modern kids' maturation is mediated to a much lesser extent by clear and well-defined development prospects, by close relations with adults. And by the authors' hypothesis, cultural texts start act as child development mediators. In this regard an issue concerning a developmental potential of these texts is raised. The authors give reasons for necessity of new developmental psychology research in the context of a culture-historical theory that would be based on updated data. Two empirical studies are described. An analysis of a preschoolers' game inspired by plots of modern animated series revealed, in the first place, a possibility in principle to organize games with the developmental potential on the basis of modern animated cartoons, and in the second place, a kids' ability to use for their games plots where relations between characters are complicated and mixed. These data expand the notion of a child's play prototype, and so far it was considered to be a fairytale with well-defined boundaries of good and evil. Modern kids can reproduce while playing more sophisticated and more complicated relations between characters. To find out why books about Harry Potter written by J. Rowling are so popular with adolescents, pupils of the 8th-10th grades were interviewed, as well as participants of Internet forums on Potteriana. Respondents also took some projective tests. It turns out that for adolescents an initiative action, an outstanding, heroic deed with an unknown result has a great appeal. Besides, the adolescents attribute a possibility of such an action to a fantasy, magic world, and as for the physical reality, they qualify it as gray and dull. On the basis of these findings the authors draw a conclusion that modern cultural texts imply a sophisticated spectator and reader, give freedom and openness, offer to take action in a situation of ambiguity and uncertainty; that is to say, they form a non-didactic mode of interaction in principle. Modern cultural texts for kids and adolescents have the developmental potential but are ignored by an educational system.","Action; Age of adolescence; Childhood; Childhood crisis; Culture-historical theory; Fairytale; Maturation; Reading; Role-playing game; Subjectness",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

It is reasoned in the article why a focus on specific labour market segments and a nature of a university basic product are used as grounds for a typology and sorting out of groups of organizations. On the basis of the formulated approach to the typology the Soviet ""master plan"" is reconstructed, since, from the authors' point of view, the present-day Russian higher education system structure is greatly determined by the Soviet experience of its development. The authors show that the Soviet project was based on the idea of an administrative labour market control, as well as on a number of historically developed institutional peculiarities, and on the whole it ran a model of a quasi-corporate higher vocational education system. It is analyzed how the higher education system structure received by Russia from the Soviet Union changed under the influence of external factors for the education system and only in the least thanks to a conscious public policy. On the basis of an analysis of quantitative data a typology of higher education organizations resulted from these changes is described. The authors consider possible structural policy directions in the field of higher vocational education as a foundation for working out a ""master plan"" of restructuring the higher education system in Russia. Goals are set that upgrading of the higher education structure should meet: involving Russia into global knowledge and technology networks; meeting the key industries' demands for personnel and for research work which would help the country to achieve competitiveness; supporting a basic socio-economic structure in a region; meeting an increasing demand of the population for higher education.","Differentiation; Educational reforms; Higher education system; Institutional diversity; Internal higher education institution's diversification; Labour market",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

For that, we introduce sequential pattern structures, an original specification of pattern structures for dealing with sequential data. Sequential pattern structures are given by a subsumption operation between set of sequences, based on subsequence matching. To avoid a huge number of resulting concepts, domain knowledge projections can be applied. The original definition of projections is revised in order to operate on sequential pattern structures in a meaningful way. Based on the introduced definition, several projections of sequential pattern structures involving domain or expert knowledge are defined and discussed. This projections are evaluated on a real dataset on care trajectories where every hospitalization is described by a heterogeneous tuple with different fields. The evaluation reveals interesting concepts and justify the usage of introduced projections of sequential pattern structures. This research work provides a new and efficient extension of FCA to deal with complex data, which can be an alternative to the analysis of sequential datasets. © paper author(s), 2013.","Formal concept analysis; Pattern structures; Projections; Sequences; Sequential pattern structures","Information analysis; Textile printing; Domain knowledge; Expert knowledge; Pattern structure; Projections; Sequences; Sequential data; Sequential patterns; Subsequence matching; Formal concept analysis","","CEUR-WS","10th International Conference on Concept Lattices and Their Applications, CLA 2013","15 October 2013 through 18 October 2013",,111236,16130073,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924409264

In contrast, the approach proposed in this paper utilizes a set of easy to use techniques having complexity less than the quadratic. We apply super-threshold procedures sequentially in order to find the best alternatives. The application to learning to rank problem is also considered. Finally, two methods of defining thresholds and order of criteria in super-threshold procedures are studied. While the first method is based on the etalon criterion, the second method uses the distribution function. Both methods developed are mainly oriented on the choice of search results in search engines and capable of processing large amount of data in networks, but can also be applied to any system in which the alternatives are represented by a set of criteria. © 2013 The Authors.

The evidence suggests dry bulk time charter rates weekly returns exhibit symmetric distribution. As an auxiliary output stands for the result of copula fit accounting for time dynamics and not. For the purpose of conservative analysis (i.e. risk-management) approach disregarding time-dynamics should be preferred as yielding the least number of value-at-risk breaches.

Rather, and more specifically, verb forms expressing reference to the past or conveying perfective semantics are more impaired than verb forms expressing reference to the non-past (present or future) or conveying imperfective semantics, both in comprehension and production. The present study used some structural properties of Russian to systematically test the interaction of time reference and aspect in non-fluent and fluent aphasia.The Test for Assessment of Reference of Time (TART; Bastiaanse, Jonkers, & Thompson, 2008; Russian version Dragoy & Bastiaanse, 2010) was used to elicit production of four verb forms in sentence context: past perfective, non-past perfective, past imperfective and non-past imperfective. The results showed that non-past time reference had a general advantage over past time reference, all aspectual forms being collapsed. However, an interaction between time reference and aspect was found: imperfective verbs were better produced in the non-past, whereas production of perfective verbs was better preserved in the past time frame. Non-fluent and fluent aphasic speakers showed largely overlapping performance.These results demonstrated that the advantage of a particular time reference depends on aspectual characteristics of the verb. The performance of both non-fluent and fluent aphasic speakers can be explained in terms of prototypical and non-prototypical matches of time reference and aspectual semantics: perfectives primarily refer to completed, past events while imperfectives prototypically describe ongoing, non-past events. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Aphasia; Aspect; Russian; Tense; Time reference","adult; aphasia; article; clinical article; controlled study; ethnic group; female; grammar; human; male; phoneme; priority journal; Russian Federation; semantics; speech articulation; speech rate; stimulus response; task performance; time perception",,,,,,,09116044,,JONEE,"English","J.

In the process of updating beliefs, differences in the weighting of private and publicly available social information may modulate the probability that a cascade starts in a decisive way. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined neural activity while participants updated their beliefs based on the decisions of two fictitious stock market traders and their own private information, which led to a final decision of buying one of two stocks. Computational modeling of the behavioral data showed that a majority of participants overweighted private information. Overweighting was negatively correlated with the probability of starting an informational cascade in trials especially prone to conformity. Belief updating by private information was related to activity in the inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex; the more a participant overweighted private information, the higher the activity in the inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula and the lower in the parietal-temporal cortex. This study explores the neural correlates of overweighting of private information, which underlies the tendency to start an informational cascade. © The Author (2014).","Belief updating; FMRI; Informational cascades; Insular cortex; Parietal cortex; Social influence","adult; algorithm; brain; brain cortex; brain mapping; computer simulation; cultural anthropology; decision making; female; frontal lobe; human; individuality; male; mental function; nerve tract; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; psychological model; social environment; young adult; Adult; Algorithms; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cerebral Cortex; Computer Simulation; Culture; Decision Making; Female; Frontal Lobe; Humans; Individuality; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mental Processes; Models, Psychological; Neural Pathways; Social Environment; Young Adult",,"Oxford University Press",,,,,17495016,,,"English","Soc.

It is argued, however, that speed in natural language is a primarily temporal concept involving the comparison of the temporal properties of a 'target situation' with those of a 'norm'. Speed terms are shown to develop their own metaphors and metonymies, subsequently becoming connectors and intensifying markers.

However, the dynamics of ICT development depends on the global challenges and broader trends that define long-term S&T priorities. What factors that will influence the future of the ICT industry? What technological solutions will determine its characteristics in the next 15-20 years? These and similar questions were considered by the HSE ISSEK specialists in co-operation with the colleagues from other research entities while investigating trends in S&T at the global and national levels. The experts have analyzed socio-economic and S&T challenges affecting the ICT sector, advanced R&D fields, markets for innovative products and services, estimated the «windows of opportunities» for Russia. As a result, the strategic directions of blueprint research which ensure the basis for the creation of innovative products and new markets for the medium- and long-term (beyond 2020) perspective. Foresight results have been validated by the representatives of leading companies, research centers, universities and international organizations. Among the solutions expected in the period up to 2030 are the prototypes of systems implementing the new computing principles and multi-language software for extraction and formalization of knowledge, technologies dealing with «big data», new analytical tools (personal analytic systems, means of the real time data processing, mobile analytics, etc.). Markets for novel technology solutions are expected to be rapidly growing in healthcare, energy, engineering and transport, as well as in personal usage of ICT products and services. The study allows to conclude that in the medium to long term, the ICT sector will retain a high growth dynamic and will have transformative impact on virtually all areas of human life. The life cycle of technologies, related products and services will shorten. In this context, R&D development plays a crucial role for keeping up with competitors. Russian science has a certain potential in much of the considered areas, although one can hardly perceive Russia as gaining global leadership.

Instead of promoting an active and strong international actor, we face the apparent decline of an international security actor in the making The thesis of this research is that there are two groups of negative variables: the lack of resources and the confusion concerning a vision about the exact position for the EU in the international arena. This paper will focus on the lack of institutional, economic, political and strategic resources. The framework for our analysis is the international paradigm change and the upheaval in the distribution of global power. The Union finds itself bewildered and unable to take a position on the axis of world power, or stakes in the field of global dominance. Instead, member states show their reluctance to increase resources for the EU-or a disoriented CDSP. Yet, strengthening the CSDP would be a necessary approach for the EU to adapt to the current international environment, utilizing its specific civilian and military capacities to address its myriad security concerns. Evaluating the outcome of the Common Security and Defence Policy today can be discouraging, as the results are not the ones intended by the reforms introduced in the Treaty of Lisbon (Howorth 2007): disappointments span from the Libya crisis to the problems of agreeing on the EDA budget, and from a continuous lack of capabilities to the role played individually by some member states (Lancaster agreement, Franco-German axis, national business with defence industry). In fact, only one new EU operation has been deployed since 2009 (with two ready for launch), compared with twenty-three from 2003 to 2008. In sum, instead of promoting an active and strong international actor, we face the apparent decline of an international security actor in the making. Our analytic approach, more than strictly theoretical, will be political and strategic. As the logical consequence of exogenous forces, most notably the diminishing relative military significance attached by the United States (US) to European security, the CSDP should be promoted as a way for European countries to improve their own security-and then their power, and as a way to adapt to the current international environment, so different from the one existing when the CSDP started. Today it seems clear from the facts described below, as well as the economic weakness of member states, that the defense of Europe needs a European defense, the CSDP (Perruche 2012). If CFSP changes its aims, ambitions and capabilities, it will imply a change in the European Security Strategy too. 4If there is a possibility to escape from the grim situation described, it should start by a clear analysis of the negative variables influencing the EU’s current defense position. A critical assessment of the achievements and the current weaknesses should be the starting point to overcome the paralysis. According to our thesis, we can summarize these negative variables in two groups: the lack of resources, and the confusion concerning the exact position the EU should strive for in international arena.

The factors that affect spatial concentration and regional disparities in Russia are population density, size and accessibility of markets, as well as the level of diversification.

It focuses on how temporal meanings are developed from spatial meanings. We relate three temporal constructions with the preposition pod to spatial constructions with the same preposition. It is argued that the preposition iz-pod is a blend of the two prepositions iz 'from' and pod 'under'. This argument is supported by symmetry between the spatial uses of both prepositions, and the fact that a temporal construction with the preposition iz-pod is directly related to one of the temporal constructions with the preposition pod. We show that temporal uses of both pod and iz-pod develop from peripheral spatial uses. Moreover only directional spatial constructions have parallels in the domain of time.

The lattice parameters of the alloys are determined by comparing them with a standard sample placed on the surface of the sample under study. As the standard, a silicon crystal is used, and its lattice parameter is measured by the high-precision Bond method. The Debye temperatures of the alloys are determined from the temperature dependences of the integrated X-ray diffraction line intensities.

Opinions on the global university education crisis issues raised by Barber and others are rather diverse and include both sympathetic summaries of the key authors' ideas and opposing some disputable points and related arguments. Factors identified by American researchers are analyzed in the context of affecting the modification of the university paradigm in Russian education. Apart from challenges posing external threats for the higher education system as an economic sector, there is one internal challenge specific of Russia. Higher education is largely simulated in Russia, as inefficient universities create accessible state-funded places but do not provide quality education services. The authors find something that American researchers did not cover in their report but what is of great importance for Russian education - that is the need to perform a deep and radical transformation of the secondary education system in order to provide opportunities for high performance of universities. Models of universities of the future suggested in the report are explored to see if they can be applied to the Russian educational system. It is concluded that American researchers have definitely made a big achievement by specifying the set of issues to be resolved in order to open broad prospects for higher education.","Educational reform; Globalization; Higher education; Russian university education; Simulated education; Transformations in educational system; University",,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics",,,,,18149545,,,"Russian","Vopr.

To control for effects of the processing of negation as such, neutral adverbs were also presented in negative and affirmative contexts. The results did not show any significant effect of negation for the non-polar adverbs, allowing context effects for polarity items to be interpreted as being due to the appropriateness of the context. Negative polarity violations elicited an N400 response that might reflect the lack of semantic congruity of the negative polarity item in an affirmative context. In contrast, processing positive polarity items in context of negation resulted in a positive effect resembling the P600, which may be considered as a marker of a different sort of integration difficulty caused by violation of licensing conditions and/or a search for a licensor in the wider discourse context. The study presented here is the first to show an unambiguous dissociation between responses to negative and positive polarity violations. This dissociation argues for different mechanisms underlying the processing of these two types of polarity; we propose that positive polarity items are sensitive to wider discourse context, while negative polarity items are more sensitive to local lexical context. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","ERPs; Language comprehension; Negative polarity positive polarity; Processing of negation","adult; affirmative action; article; behavior; cognition; event related potential; female; human; human experiment; integration; linguistics; male; medical ethics; negative polarity; normal human; polarization; positive polarity; semantics; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Comprehension; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Female; Humans; Linguistics; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Reaction Time; Semantics; Time Factors; Young Adult",,,,,,,00283932,,NUPSA,"English","Neuropsychologia",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870991617

We use high-energy Earth orbits that can be drastically modified with lunar swingbys and small propulsive maneuvers, especially near the collinear Sun-Earth and Earth-Moon libration points. The work builds on ideas developed by the International Academy of Astronautics' exploration study group presented at the 2008 International Astronautical Congress in Glasgow. The first human missions beyond low-Earth orbit will probably go to the vicinity of the translunar Earth-Moon libration point; these are discussed in separate papers. This paper will concentrate on the next possible step, which might be for servicing large space telescopes in Sun-Earth libration-point orbits. Next, flyby and rendezvous missions to Near-Earth Objects (NEO's) will be presented, with some emphasis on options for defense against potentially hazardous objects. Finally, trajectories to reach Mars, first to Phobos and/or Deimos, will be outlined. The study will use highly-elliptical Earth orbits (HEOs) whose line of apsides can be rotated using lunar swingbys. The HEO also provides a convenient and relatively fast location for rendezvous with crew, or to add propulsion or cargo modules, a technique that we call ""Phasing Orbit Rendezvous"". From a HEO, a propulsive maneuver, considerably smaller than that needed from a circular low-Earth orbit, can be applied at the right perigee to send the spacecraft on the right departure asymptote to a desired destination. A propulsive maneuver at perigee can be used to re-capture the spacecraft into a loosely-bound orbit at the return, perhaps helped with a lunar swingby. But the astronauts onboard could separate in an Apollo-style capsule for a direct Earth return. Earth-Moon (and possibly Sun-Earth) libration point orbits and double-lunar swingby orbits, like those flown first by the third International Sun-Earth Explorer, will be used, along with time to change the orbital orientation between missions. There might be waits of several months between missions, when the interplanetary spacecraft could be ""parked"" in a small-amplitude Lissajous orbit about a libration point, similar to that flown by the WMAP mission. During that time, if there wasn't an L2 space telescope needing servicing, the spacecraft could be unmanned and controlled remotely from the Earth. Sequential missions to fly by and then rendezvous with NEO's will be described, followed by a mission to the Martian moons.",,"Computer software reusability; International cooperation; Interplanetary flight; Manned space flight; Orbits; Space telescopes; Spacecraft; Circular low-Earth orbits; International Academy of Astronautics; International collaborations; International sun-earth explorers; Libration point orbits; Near earth objects; Orbital orientation; Potentially Hazardous Objects; Lunar missions","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","64th International Astronautical Congress 2013, IAC 2013","23 September 2013 through 27 September 2013","Beijing",106314,00741795,9781629939094,,"English","Proc.

We propose the construct of contextualism, referring to beliefs about the importance of context in understanding people, as a facet of cultural collectivism. A brief measure was developed and refined across 19 nations (Study 1: N = 5,241), showing good psychometric properties for cross-cultural use and correlating well at the nation level with other supposed facets and indicators of I-C. In Study 2 (N = 8,652), nation-level contextualism predicted ingroup favoritism, corruption, and differential trust of ingroup and outgroup members, while controlling for other facets of I-C, across 35 nations. We conclude that contextualism is an important part of cultural collectivism.
